# life.

<!--
Welcome to life. A rancid fascination of all things particular. An overwhelming sense of asymptotic reference. America's rag-doll daddy of putty intentions, spluttered vicious into the cultural misappropriation you witness before your very eyes. This is where all stories begin, end and...

"Truly fantastic", announces the editor from across the room, as he swivels in his chair towards my general direction. Hesitant in a gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery; mouth struck brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares. Taint within the star-mangled biscuits adjourned thin across the maltodextrin fabric of his crumb-infused sweater. Inconspicuously store-bought, we presume, for our excited listeners at home. For he was the mindless operator who would introduce himself as my only lifeline into the world of publishing, and I was the pathetic liar who intended to milk his acquaintance for all it was worth. Milk. Acquaintance. He licks his lips with a sickening kvetch. Botch n' bauble. Sordidly numb. My eyes quiver with a hopeless anticipation, outward upon the defective commentary I'd come to endure over the past hour and a half without whim. Much like observing a child attempting to hang itself lyrically with the stock of a gun, perhaps it'd be quicker if I'd just shot him instead.

"I really, really liked what you did there. I thought it was simply fantastic! The imagery. The sex appeal. I could definitely fuck that, if you know what I mean."

Dawdled frantic onto a notepad fit suitably for a 90s' Nickelodeon pre-teen, it was clear he had no idea what he was talking about. Hell, I wasn't even quite sure if he knew who I was. You know, perhaps this would become the beginning of some laborious online prank, where I, the unwitting idiot, would be exposed as some part-time celebrity on a popular Japanese game show. A sure highlight in my non-existent career as a writer, as the editor awaits his cue to run towards the hidden camera and shout "We got ya!" like a trained hyena on wheels. I mean, sure. I'd probably fuck it too. Me and my words dressed in mortal calamity. Blind in an unfortunate sexual encounter involving my last moments in an exploding orgasm, and a terribly shy lackey with a syllable for a grin. Who even was this man?

I suppose it was the level of respect I garnered as an unknown assailant, possibly attached to his meaningless gestures delivered haphazardly like the illegitimate leader of an unknown guerrilla war. Che Guevara au lite. The raved lunatic of a ritual patriarchal circle-jerk. Head o' the New an' Improved Mickey Mouse Club. Accent dripped-thick in the ancient tar of a dead Italian; laid-limp over his heartless sleeves and into the repeating glares of purgatory. A cursory sanctuary for two-time real estate agents and doofus car salesmen, as they gather to worship thee enumeration of thy poor. Ultimately, the editor was a man propped n' reassured by the might n' glory of a three-hour Tony Robbins' lecture, cantankerously basked in a level of self-gratification not last seen since the Holy Roman Empire.

Then across the border, sitting awkwardly by the wayside behind a facade of U.N. sponsored barbed-wire, enclosed within the prevailing attitudes showering its vindictive tempest and echoing dialogues of sparkling doubt and lacklustre fashion, was me. An unruly clash against the unsettling intentions revealing themselves in the faint colonies of pop-sweat rippling scarce throughout the bovine arcade of my skin. Revolting. Glorious. I couldn't have been more uncomfortable, nor under-represented in this fraudulent battering of intellectual deceit, but I assured myself that everything would be okay as long as I continued to embrace the sodomy, in full. Thankfully, Aristotle was blasphemous.

"You know, have you ever considered writing this, uh, material into a book? I think it would make for fascinating reading."

"Well yeah, that's basically why I'm here. To get my book published," sat an audaciously sad man preoccupied firmly in this very chair. Helplessly situated in an uncaught mire of time, conveniently puzzled at the present-day theatrics of this man's somewhat infectious outreach.

Then soon, an entire lifetime of small talk and faux pleasantry would transpire in my head, capturing me in arrival at Dante's fuck-pen of ill-conceived trickery. Curtaillious damnation. The plague of a thousand deaths. And in the wisp that followed from the agonising sylph of the editor's dreaded words, bore the demons of rheumy and their defiled angels of necrophilic intent. Pinning me down upon the pewter of the hardwood floors below, nailing my jaw into the rhymes of the deep oblivion churning me south. south. south. It was obvious at this point that I'd completely tuned out of whatever muffled point he was attempting to express, although I imagine it involved fucking some other aspect of my work, akin to our misaligned rivalry which had now officially expired without a licence to care. Ultimately, he wanted to see himself in everything, and I simply wanted to be acknowledged, loved and possibly adored like a house cat on trial; possibly for dragging a dead mutilated creature into the living room during the heated quarter-finals of an end-of-season football match.

I decided to reach for the mug o' water, conveniently placed next to the picture of a scantily-dressed child. Tight cheerleader's seduce. Pink moose knuckle. Presumably reared to have the words "Daddy's girl" tattooed onto her forehead before being fucked in front of a live camera-crew and eager internet audience of adolescent males. And as the lukewarm liquid of the polystyrene cup trickled down my throat and into the depths of my hunch, even my basic bodily fluids could sense the paltry catalogue of this poor man's attempt at azure. Within the space of a few hours, he had evolved into the middle-aged caricature of a homeless veteran; avidly deep-throating his prized roadkill for the thrill of the violence. The refulgence of his deadbeat practice. The falter of his mind; that filament of gore which doth shone bright upon the piercing tenement of his frail unenthusiasm. Undoubtedly, I was being played the fool as I forced myself to exhale deep into my lungs. As I attempted to bring my smile into a full, unmatched forte.

"It's fast approaching twelve and I'd absolutely kill for a bite. You like Chinese? You're Chinese, right? I mean, you just have that slight gook look to you. No offense, cutter." Sure. Wish-washing the unadulterated scum out of my life couldn't possibly offend me more than the pantomime presence of your existence, you unadultered sack of shit. I've scraped less-abrasive gunk from the self-mutilated pussy of a dead-hooker's final stand at a crackhouse clinic shootout, than I've spent today, hearing you mutter the two-ounce garbage tract of poorly-spoken English you claim is wholly integral to the left side of your brain.

Ah, who even cares anymore. I'm sure his wanton style was just the kind of tautological caprice required to turn heads and kick books into the wounded hands of yesteryear's consumer. The kind of frolic that apparently, readers desperately wanted to fuck.

Although I could identify the exit beyond the rows of offices which extended like a slinky into the poetic halls of post-consumerist antipathy, leaving itself proved futile. Between the wades of paper which defied the Law of Moses, to what seemed like a fossilised pocket of methane dating back to the Mesozoic period, left only enough oxygen within the building to support the efficient gills of literary agents and editors alike. Flustered and deprived, I attempted to trawl towards the door in a choking fit of exile, as inconspicuous hoards of office stationary surrounded me in a merciless wildfire of nomadic appeal. Begging me to stay and offer my soul to the Lord of Decor, as he sat idly by in a chromatic flavour of poncy green. From the cruft rhododendron wallpaper, to the prissy carpet stains which revealed themselves as Tommy and Russ, absolutely nothing felt untarnished nor logically brave within this maze of frivolous scruffle and hard tactics.

Even the mold from within the dark archival corners of the floor had gained somewhat of a celebrity status, occupied within neglected pails of ancient writers' manuscripts. As they hissed and coughed like a Catholic choir of addled school children, singing thy Church's most forbidden hymn. Requesting to be read in their never-end tomes of impermissible vagrancy. Apparently it was little more than a haughty Machiavellian ruse, as the editor liked to describe it; his eyes now zooming towards the large indecent apertures of this building's entrance, keen for a taste of a Chink. Through the unquivering hinge and back into the grasp of mainstream discourse. It had come time to reacquaint myself with the smack, shovel and bang of these mean city streets. If only to feel that little bit closer to home. I was beginning to get a little sick.

Chinatown is the same everywhere you go. Unadorned paper laterns slathered in the inner-city embrace of a particulate smog. Carelessly branded in an uncanny menstruation of red, quadrilateral and a cast-iron yellow, fucked and dribbled along an autistic array of blinding nationalism. A mass-produced line of chauvinistic spirit, shoved senseless within an ornate red-envelope raffishly stamped with symbols of luck and whore. Conveniently placed within arm's distance of a burnt-out firecracker n' an unsteady hit of Fentanyl. An ancient mechanism designed to forget n' impress, because as any good Chinaman worth his weight in Tang Dynasty gold knows. Family and tradition always comes first. And when your dying relative collapses at your knees, vomiting coagulated semen in a patriotic display of sex and fervour. That's when you know you've truly made it as a father and son of the People's Republic of China.

Colourful neon displays and piccadilly lights shroud the backdraw of its twisted Chinatown lanes. Harbouring the forgotten faces and contorted postures defying anatomy in the hauling duck-fat laid behind. Leading us towards our stranded destination of both food and contempt. Garbled in its contaminated squabble of polarising contention, soon to become fundamental to our very being. As our souls found themselves annexed into the smells and riches of Grandma's chicken stock. Plagued weary amidst the granular undertones of Grandpa's cigarette ash. Palatably served amongst an impure confederation of tripe and blood jelly. Billowing amongst a enveloping cloud of pre-industrial steam, as it engulfs a bamboo chorus of squeamish roe. Twisting and wrying in its undulating shriek of mass extinction. The death mellows and cracks the pulmonary alveolus grasping at my lungs. Hidden amongst a breathing stew of fermented opium and kibbled rat hair. Bubbling in wretched torment within the sewerage pipes below. A fatal delicacy most workers simply could not cherish to afford, lest they die at their table in a clenching decease. The editor barges forward.

Flocking to the streets. Vermintide folly. Naked children carelessly prance to a Communist funeral melody. Privates tucked deep inside their little foreskin gashes, ripe for the meat cleavers of Chinatown to apprehend. Thankfully the Chinese butcher is a simple rice-loving man with a delicate wife-beating texture. Often wearing nothing but a kitchen apron and a silver-chain necklace, traditionally awarded during the semi-finals of a fierce Mahjong beatdown. Cigarette in mouth. Ready to beat the grease off his forsaken cock.

Further down the duration of the road, emanating through a thick haze of prudent SARS lies a badly cut-up swine. Fit with a heinous cough and a mouth-full of regurgitated maggots, gathering in rows of the hundreds. Squirming and tossing amongst the unspeakable overtones of a young man knocked fresh from his bike by a speeding lagoon. Encircled pretty. His pretty brain now a battered mess of week-old congee, haplessly conspiring to a point of chronic anemia. As his splayed cortex streamed down into the sewers of the hotpot kitchen below, ready to serve this week's special to the crowd of a many few. Then suddenly, the deafening tintinnabulation of the bells above began their roar as the people below weakened to their hunger. Our time was nigh.

The ravage of Chinatown had commenced, as men and women alike, beat each other senseless over the cured remains of a tenderised Peking duck's asshole. Considered by many to bring luck and good fortune, as an old aunt in vile brown florals violently rubs her clitoris with a pair of coarse chopsticks. Readily her gaze before shoving the freshily prepared utensils into the cavern of her nephew's ear, which was to be chewed and suckled in meditative silence, while he sat there being devoured as he completed his fourth grade assignment. No one was safe. No one was spared. The hunger was real and the people had spoken. Thankfully, we were only moments away from our destination, as the chaos quietened and our our view widened into a precarious shade of white. Vanish into a cold dark room of orbital apprehension, privy to our newfound sense of place.

"I wanted to become a writer too once," the editor blurted, as if making some kind of ultimate sacrifice against his own will.

"But I figured the money was better on the other side of the fence, if you know what I mean. And man, I honestly couldn't think of anything worse than writing a novel. Talk about being bored shitless."

Although certain in what I heard, I wasn't quite sure how to respond. Let alone comprehend what little meaning was left in his words, as I pushed through the plastic-beads of the restaurant, designed to keep white-face like editor out.

The muted Tudor frizzle of the dilapidated walls enclosing the Chinese palace (suitably named, The Ming) drew a sense of familial brooding, as I stepped through the battered corridors and into the bright fluorescent gaze of an oriental mental ward. The laminate rows of chairs and tables confounded the general sense of space it attempted to imitate, juxtaposed against the depleted faces of a trodden theatre affair, now racing frantically to eradicate all sense of pride and honour as part of a grand self-serving pursuit of cathartic emotional absolution. The editor signalled an overwhelmed Chinese waiter by holding up his 1st and 3rd longest fingers, the international sign of peace, only to be greeted the waiter's heavily distilled face, as she guided us to our booth in the far back corner of the asylum. I doubt she had a visa.

The booth itself comfortably sat three, a necessary addition to accommodate for the timely inclusion of the editor's ego. A six-foot mirage resembling the entire backbench of Republican-majority senate, in concession with the recptive tension of an unforgiving racist and his gook-inspired raciee. Much to his character, he absolutely insisted on sitting his gargantuan backside on the cushioned fabric of the revered corner seat in dispute, because apparently the idea of anything less would have been considered a National Proclamation of Civil Disobedience. Rape, steal n' murder at any cost, and be sure to gather the receipt come tax time to assure your place on Mr. Ming's throne. Perhaps it was plain ol' American policy to be an asshole. I was almost certain of it.

"Listen, bud. I know you think I'm not the BRIGHTEST guy around, but I'm all about maintaining those important industry connections! I can get your book published anywhere, and you better believe it!", the editor remarked, unintentionally resolute in the Valium-enhanced confines of a sedated cliché. Hid behind the Sicilian dazzle of his two-piece suit endured a hairy gut of emollient dairy consumption, bursting with a gaseous reminder to shift positions every so often, so as not to disturb the pro-biotic interplay which kept his body from detonating into a proliferating spiral of compounding Tzatziki. It was a constant threat I kept replaying in my mind; another trauma to be conveyed to my therapist's ever-growing backlog of irrational condensation.

"So do you like the book?", I retorted, keen to hear what misaligned innocence could be extracted from the two useless lumps of flesh surrounding his open-closey thingy. At this point, I doubted whether he even had the capacity to read at all, as he confidently placed his hands behind his head, ever-so nearly knocking a priceless Imperial Chinese vase off its edge. He laughed casually at the thought of vase plunging onto the glacial tiles below, shattering into a thousand tiny pieces and leaving Mr. Ming in a state of inconsolable anger, only to choke on his spit in a sudden inconvenience of harrowing self-interest, as he started banging his fist on the table in a confused mess of inhumane discomfort. Truly, the editor at times was like witnessing a stray deer escape from its prey, gasping in a tattered relief of residual safety, only to be shot in the head by a lone ranger with a fine taste for Midwest Whitetail. Thankfully, he only managed to pour a tiny amount of Kahlua into his coffee this morning, presumably to counter the hangover he'd developed from previous night earlier downing shots with some of his work buddies. All in a day's hard work.

"I think it has potential, kid," the editor replies, who in a momentary relapse of bad faith, reveals himself as an incapacitated three-year-old with a strong desire for mother's milk, before snapping back into his elusive adult form, remaining cautiously silent as per the dubious contract he'd maintained with the five-mile dead-zone preoccupying his brain.

"Although I must say, most of it really made no sense to me at all. Putty intentions? What the fuck even is that? Is it some kind of weird sexual thing you people are into, because you know I don't do that freaky shit."

"I mean, I gue...", the bastard cut me off. I wasn't sure how much more of his insufferable horseshit I could continue to endure, but my heart was wearing thin in this ludicrous takeover of fist-meets-tongue.

"Hey waiter! Where are the dumps at! I'm just kiddin' pal, don't get all chinky with me. Although I would really appreciate a fresh menu. This one smells like chicken, or some shit. Oh, and two seltzer waters please! That's with an American s. The bubbly stuff. Man, it really is like tryin' throat-fuck a sauna in here, huh?", stammered the editor, insisting that the waiter stand by in full motion, ink to be dispersed at any moment in an inexplicable rage of Chinese cursive, as he scanned through the menu with the hobbling globber of a dying senior in the midst of a cardiac arrest. What truly perplexed me was how the editor had managed to degrade so explicitly into a deplorable slosh of bigotry, or had I simply been naive this entire time? Perhaps it was just what I'd become accustomed to as a slant with no name. Another cunder to be punt. Serialised in a rhythmic cacophony pretension.

"Let's see. I will have the 6-piece pork dumpling set, a chicken n' corn soup and uhh, could I please also have a large serving of Singapore noodles. They're real Singapore noodles, right?"

Our waiter, the holy accolade of Mr. Ming himself, exercised a compendium of disaffection in the broken English she repeated in direct contempt towards the editor, which trod on a level of disrespect which transcended all faithful considerations. Certainly, I doubt Mr. Ming enjoyed witnessing his daughter being harassed by a middle-aged white sock of disappearing youth, as the deliriously over-worked restaurant owner stood cautiously by in the adjacent back far corner of the mental ward. Eyeing his customer's every intent. Especially the oodles of wasted food which sparked disdain in the eyes of our Mr. Ming, presupposed by the deep sighs of the malnourished sous-chefs in the back kitchen of the restaurant, butchering slabs of a glazed pork into thinly-sliced bundles of coy. Noodle in. Noodle out. Break a hand and call me Gonzo. I was ready to order.

"I think I'll have the..."

"So junior, tell me about this book then. Are we talkin' fantasy? I mean, I don't remember readin' about no goblins or nuthin'. You know I don't do fantasy, right?"

For bare moment we both stared at each other like an opposing pack of hyenas, ready to tear each other to shreds. He was perpetually confused at even the most basic of written interpretations and I couldn't stand to bear any of it. Maybe we were both simply too old, too bothered in our own ways to truly want to understand each other. And aside from literally grabbing my spoon and shoving it into the sinuous socket of his left eye, there was little I could do to contain the anger and frustration that had constructed itself to a maze of smouldering evisceration. I'd simply had enough.

"This reaaaallly isn't going to work out," I scowled in a tight-lipped fury, hand on my bag, ready to engage in an unplanned prison-break, only to be interrupted by Miss. Ming and her blue-laced bowls of hot steaming Chinese food. For a few moments he sat there, overcome by his own crushing morality, confused at the very fate which he had sealed with his own two hands. Well, I wasn't quite sure how he felt, as I observed him sit in relative silence, breaking his fork into the trembling shimmer of his Singapore noodles, gobblin' up the rasher twins' lesser cousins in an all-out homicide of culinary scorched-earth. All I knew was that the mood had soured into a guava pulp of rotten aspirations, held down by a violent clash his own worst vulnerabilities, as he broke down sobbing into a piffling steam of oyster-sauce.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry," cried the editor, with bits of fake Singapore noodle stuck to his face.

"I need this job. I really fucking need it. Fuck. I'm on last strings buddy. You don't know how badly I need this. They're going to fire me! I know it. I just know it! I can give you anything you want, just please work with me," His cheek-bones bore the pity of a decrepit widow, held together by a chain of cigarettes which kept those ol' lungs pretty. Two incompatible fuck-buddies, with a schedule which barely fit in enough time to spend with our lesbian wives. He saw red and I saw yellow. He wanted cream and I wanted to spit in his mouth and fuck his daughter with a knife to her throat, before killing the rest of the family in a postal slaughter of unkempt rape, because this cunt had it coming to him. And although he knew it too, I certainly wasn't keen on teaching a dead dog new tricks.

"It's almost as if you didn't even read the book! How can you be so fucking dense!?", I yelled, personally hand-crafting my words in such a way that they would eventually reach the hollow cavern of his brain, now attempting to recruit a gallow of well-trained monkeys to decipher the ploy of sabotage being hurled his way.

"What, are you callin' me stupid!? Do you even know who I am!?", retorted the editor in a barbaric plea for self-righteous proclamation, a defensive mechanism sought to eradicate all potential responsibility from his repertoire of life-sucking heuristics. He was a cock-sucking prat and I was going to show it to him.

"Does it even make a fucking difference, you FUCKING idiot!? Go fuck yourself. Don't even try to call me. I'm done. I hope you lose your fucking job you stupid piece of shit. You deserve it."

The plain insincerity of the flaked-paint ceiling shifted its muted colours into a dark purple of valiant rose, drawing the poor yuppie into a sober chamber of insulated regret. Perhaps for the first time in his life, the editor didn't quite know how to respond. No answer to the looming divorce of thy union. No conceivable way to writhe his way back into pole position. No method to express how little control he had over the situation. No loophole to charm or linger. No words or audience to please. He was an irrelevant puddle of defeat, and I made sure to let him know of his stature in the crinkle slade of disappointment I displayed on my face, as I lifted myself up from the table and walked away. Mussing my fingers along the slippery tiled walls of the harrowing corridor and out through the plastic-bead opening keeping him in. Chinatown had spoken.

As I gawked my way out of The Ming, dead in a primal pursuit of counter-clock rage, I stopped for a moment in the middle of the sidewalk to return myself to a more cosy collection of thoughts. A delicious bowl of ramen soup, I thought to myself. That's what I craved, as my empty stomach gargled in a churlish snicker of twinkle n' pink. And yet as I walked down these disease-ridden lanes, plastered many times over with a volcanic certainty of cheap glue and holographic print, I couldn't quite shake the anger that I felt for life, as the tip of my knees sank like a chasm into the mound of my socks. Like a slow-tide of faithlessness being dragged back into reef, it was the kind of deuce which left you flaccid in a mass-hysteria of unanimous public despondence. I reassured myself that I didn't need him. That he was trash, and that I would find another editor to publish my book, even if it meant kidnapping one myself.

I pass an old Chinese man selling chop-chop along the side of the road. He begins shouting at me in a roast of incomprehensible Chinese. Perhaps he recognised me. Perhaps he wanted to tell me something important. I threw him a dollar as he sat there bewildered at the generosity of my gesture. I was in no mood to play prophecy. At the very least I understood how I didn't want my book published, abused and slawed in slimy knockdown of soaked arrest. I glanced down at my watch and swore. Fuck. It was only 2 in the afternoon and I still had to return to work. Hopefully no one had realised how long I'd disappeared for, although I found that highly unlikely. Unfortunately, it didn't stop me from trying.
