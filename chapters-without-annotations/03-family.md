A ten-ounce packet o' Hershey's sperm. That's all it takes to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big ol' sack o' genetic fanaticism, splendid within the pseudoephedrine-encapsulated collaborations encrusting sin around the outline of your mother's vagina; a relative cum dumpster of fire and pre-maritime froth, participating in the ooze of father's industrial-strength facial cream. Farewell, we roth in a baste of thy sin. An ode to the eroding hopes and dreams of thy children not yet born.

Oh, golly gosh. It seems we've just described a cunt, as we continue to pickle n' loam at the coquette mannequin drowning in the huzzah of a candilicious splice; daffle at the misery you fuck, my dear child, like a peppermint rendezvous at a Chinese bordello. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in al fresco self-abuse, along with a tempestuous Cert IV in the erroneous art of counterfeit puppeteering, it appears your fortunes have been generously funded by the Catholic Cum Laude and their pack of Irish henchmen. Hallowed by thy pleasure. Shant be thy name. And for those less fortunate and undeserving of the inconspicuous price of college, a thirty-two ounce bucket of ejaculate is all it takes to push n' pull through our beautiful fuck-thing, as our dashing pre-star announces her untouched body to the presence of fifty-two young emotionally-jacked men. Pumped to the brim with imitation testosterone and disc jockey enthusiasm; cascade in a panoramic anxiety of knucklehead casualty n' enigmatic violence. A daring challenge for this new generation of Ikea-inspired holes, designed solely to fit three fingers n' a vape for use in-between Russian clit lectures.

I always wondered if I'd have a piece of this one day, as I stared out of the illuminated train windows and into the rolling hills of splendor. A mere evening touch upon the lush green crust of suburbia, which upheld the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options breathing dust into the brown insoluble clay of our first people's home. Monstrous 60s' Brutalism. Communist Party Exuberance. These were the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched forlorn by an incomplete set of Chinese housewives, confident in their feudal charm. Pure amalgamations of smog n' flesh to be paraded around like illegible cucks of efflorescent parrots, chattering away in their unpenned cantons with the ambling blather of a punctured tea bag. As they defiled the neighbourhood with their bargain-bin cardigans n' Worchester-stained smiles; sapless in their hearts' denial. The artificial lakes. The sprawling retirement. The orange provocative. Host to an extravagant display of finger-lickin' grandeur, thrust manic through a vision which held itself in fake competition with the avaricious cancer it identified as growth. Confined in a vacuum of its own moaning anguish; grumble to the marble countertop kitchens which weighed upon its behest. I walk past a pram constructed of recycled Norbertine children, as it whispered quietly into the infliction of the void for future generations to beware. Their fragile arms and legs were packed ravage into a frantic frenzy of kleptocratic privilege; tied and bound to the sequestering smirks of the supercilious Chinese men expressing callow at the height of their step. Bumptious in a drunken craze of opium and cabin repress. The homeless man to my left wears a gold jade necklace. Cock firmly erect at the thought of a five-star dinner, as he lay there demented in a hound of Trotskyite atrocity. A facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the Chinese upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

The 21st Century Asian was a fickle creature which did not need what it saw, wanting only what it'd heard from the intersexual prejudice of a swivet albino. They were a Hollywood bonanza of Western desires; lovingly adored n' confirmed inside the steel-reinforced complex of a megalomanic childhood. To be exquisitely crafted by the brilliant tacticians of foiled bitterness which squirmed from their mother's spoilt breast milk, as a second-hand reminder of their own materialised inferiority. Then from the corner of my eye accelerates a white base-model Mercedes Benz, ramming into the curb without a callous of suspicious intent. Entirely paid for with company fraud, transporting what was later identified to be the idled wretch of a dead daughter's fetus. As its embryonic tendrils hurled towards the windshield in an acrimonious splatter of percolate fortune, seething upon the scalding backseat of a hot summer's regret. Another languid leathery detail for the gangrenous toothpick of life to repent, for the base-model Mercedes was a counsel of status for the hoary Asian man stalking the inglorious outskirts of these treacherous suburbian streets; fit in a prophylactic redundancy of sexual arousal n' crossed metaphors, ferrying what appeared to be a heavy lead pipe n' an irrational desire for hard liquor. Wifebeater on. Military haircut engaged. Cigarette in the lop of an unidentified ear; legs spread wide across a coriaceous plate of Hungarian túró, to be slopped round' the mouth with a dollop o' hoisin purée. The suburbian asian man was little more than a walking high-rise of plastic duty. Anatomy paid for in cheap sex and even cheaper dinner meals, just like mother ordered when Chiang Kai Shek and his nationalist gang kicked down the front doors of her elastic forebode. Distraught to the face. Rape to the floor; a yellow collective of misogynistic employ. Me so sorry.

As I approached the rickety gate of the unkempt weatherboard estate, I couldn't help but notice the surreal elongation of my cosmos. The elasticised walnut. The eroded purple. Thistles the size of cabins, entrenched upon their positions along a would-be brick parchment of trial n' fear. Battleground to an overdue kingdom of inner-suburbian mice, whom under the delegation of God, had invented war and religion with the degenerate mew of an invertebrate Jew. Succulents and cacti of every kind, retrofit into an assortment of smashed pots and non-stick pans. Braced along a poorly-paved driveway, seemingly held together by particles of cinder n' refined palm oil. As their molecules flourished n' churned into a chemical absolution of sanctified degrade; consent to wither n' perish amongst the dust n' ice perils which lay ahead on this journey of descent. Subject to the quell horrors of the tantamount soak resting pale beneath my feet; schisming recidivous in a open seizure of tumble n' decay. Raring to swallow me into its posture of resolute caxon, as my eyes grew weary of the front facade declining my ability to default. It truly was a post-mortem construction of shackled aggrievances; a sick sympathy of existence, praying at the border for its ethos to be drowned n' washed away. I quietly made my way along the breach of the smouldering house, as I fettered in through the backdoor in hopes of being avoided; knowing deep-down inside that I was merely postponing the barrage of not-quite disappoint which was certain to come my way. For this was the house of my mother.

Admittedly, I wasn't particularly keen to kick the dirt with Mammy Madras. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap, slathered n' smeared onto the mummified corpse of a freeze-dried Tibetan whore. Operational only in the sheer amount of high thread count linen required to prevent the awful stench of yesterday's lingering bamboo cookware, ferment to a homely intuition of Tuscan crustaceans and week-old diverticulosis. She was neither a mother by name, nor in the tradition of a convoluted metaphor to be pondered at gun point whilst screaming into the barrel of a loaded gun. For it takes love and understanding to create a mother; two things I lived without. Neither by choice, nor by compass. In fact, I felt little of the clattering pile of bones and ash which spoke such misfortune, with exception to the seeping animosity which bloomed like a pond of algae in reins of my heart. Suffocating all life below in an attempt to survive the paltry misforgivings of a bunt wretch. Succubus to my world, she was nothing more than a sully pair of slapshot hands, pushing and shoving me towards the human equivalent of an emotional meat-grinder. Forget the hugs and the postulate encouragement every young man yearned for in his time on earth, and lay welcome to a new duopoly of ecclesiastical autocracy. With our King of back-handed compliments and our Queen of soul-piercing atrophy, paving our way forward towards a faulty expedition of stifling insecurity and suicidal thoughts; packed elegantly into a used condom to be assisted with your new-found insecurity for motherly love. As you sit idly by with a dead cupid in your hands, creatively discovering new ways to feel helpless within the annihilation of your own self-assurance. Later to be confused with the primordial lust you conjure at even the slightest hint of affection; your brain and me, voted most likely to part ways and never interact again. Put simply, she was never around to care.

Instead, I was strictly to be used as her subject of comparison to the infinite marginalisation of her boundless tyranny, like an advisory board of curdled chutney, to be diced n' sautéed into a Crème brûlée of pickling torment n' pulverised tastelessness. It was in the grain of her blood to pursue persecution, demention and imprisonment. To embrace the thin strands of judgement coursing blue through the enhanced optic pathways of her hardened arteries, in what a doctor once described as an ephemeral stew of caustic joy. In her eyes, and by the power vested in me by the design of nature itself, it was impossible for me to meet her sculptured standards irrespective of how hard I tried. My intellect. My genetics. My innate ability to feel. All notable concerns on this creaky prize-wheel of informal mother-son assessment, to be carefully decomposed and decremented into a decree of supple factuality; caught in an unending loop of fatal incomprehension, that even God himself would ruin. It was in her duty to insistently measure and customise my self-esteem to the sieve of her lavarous attention, iterating my existence so that I could better fit her ideal image of a son, if only so I could just be that little bit more unobtainably taller. Akin to the awe n' beauty of a broken leaf. Crisp in a vat of blistering expectation. Trapped inside her matrix of unrealistic criterion. Holding on, only by the synapses taunting you awake.

Thankfully, she was also getting older. As her greying hairs dominated the narrative of her unremitting attempts to remain relevant within the wrath she once bore with violence; eyes in sway like an aging tiger. Too weak to pull at the strings controlling her perception of the world around her, yet so completely comfortable in the conviction she wore with pride. In other words, she was a cunt with a duck for a face.

"You're late!", larks a small upright figure. Face like a porcelain horse. Spatula in hand. Ready to strike at the given.

"Fuck you," I respond in an immediate thrash of anger. At least that's what I wish I'd said, as my mother's viscous glare pervaded into the enusing silence of my buffeted despair; desperately attempting to seep from my mouth with the patent oxidation of an emotional creep. Prophesied to enact justice on thy foe. Perhaps it would serve as an impalpable excuse to knock her two front teeth out with the force of my bare knuckles; an opportunity to throw her stunned corpse into the full retirement of a disguised wood chipper. Chirpity. Chirp. Chip.

And without remise, kneeling in faithful gratitude for the Newtonic elements of the sun, was her helper. A frail old Estonian man with the Stockholm of a 

. The lord of preach and denial. Older, married and unsuitably kind. Neither lover, nor friend. Neither quaint, nor pretend. A farce. Amend. I never quite understood the relationship that the helper wore, only that he was one and she was infinity. The kind of doe-daddy calculation that would make even the most abstract of mathematicians want to cry. An adoration of cretin scum. Building. Sowing. Fortifying his leash on a mortified penance of penalty and punishment. A deception of human evolution. A carrier of shopping bags. Fall.

"Why don't you come to see me anymore? I'm your mother, you should treat me better." I suppose that summarised our relationship. A mechanical exchange of contracts and titles, quantified by your ability to cease and desist. An offer in one hand. Your life in the next. A sacred punishment which regressed itself as a motherly love, without the love, nor the necessity. Another sad case of right time, wrong hole. Dull me, honey.

Then in a sudden whirlwind of anchored correspondence, it became unreasonably clear to me that the woman standing in front of my very eyes was nothing more than a ruse. A pseudo-salad concoction of infallible consumption, lost so far down my throat that I could barely even taste the difference between my own plain and pleasure. It had become apparent in my eyes that my true mother was in fact the one thing which I'd spent most my life abhorring. The gentle brothel of care which had kept me engaged with my own life, far more pronounced than she ever did. My computer screen. A place for meals to be relished without the incessant precaution of judgement, where my feelings of inadequacy could be washed away in a pixel haze of hyperphallic euphoria. Stretched like a taut violin. Laced and chewed with paranoia. In a wholeful neglect of deluded femininity. A static interaction of colourful smut. Click. Click. Crunch. Curated communities of mutilated chests and cosplay vaginas, dangled as a wholesome cure for the crippling anxiety you formulate by the mouthful. The totality of your vision wanes into an attrition of befuddled harmony, as you attempt to surmount a mammoth-sized strap-on onto your child-sized knee. Satisfying your quench for cradled inclusion, diluted in a fire of self-hate and glorification. Waxing in glee, correctively at ease.

The screen was a world away from the ancient cum-ridden rituals of blowing some fat-fuck inside the confines of a gas station restroom, just to witness your first set of silicone breasts on the centre-fold of some greasy Playboy magazine. Hell, you didn't even have to leave your own bedroom, let alone the confines of your own misery shame. The screen was just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into a fantastic lust-filled self-proclamation of sex and whore, tweaking your most fundamental ambitions into an indecent inclination for cinematic nudity and makeshift affection. A young child sits cross-legged in a room alone, awaiting the online presence of his favourite cam girl. Sad. Moan. If only to feel the warm embrace of her smile, as he masturbates frantically in a glowing rash of pampered silence. And thus, we welcome our new de facto parents to the world. A semi-pregnant teenager with a face-tattoo for a passport. A glamourous opportunity to rid the stain from our genes and introduce ourselves to a new life of agrarian pleasure. My brain enveloped in something magical. The pinch of my sticky fingers clamoured together in a witness of unholy relegation. Burnt like bleached popsicles. Covered in the pornographic titillation I buffetted in isolation, as my mother gargled white dick in the bedroom over. Who'd knew you could develop an OCD for sucking cock. Perhaps I would be next.

So there I was. Sitting at my desk. Participating in my first gang-bang at the age of 12. At first it was mesmerising. Your eyes, captured in lore, dart around the screen in a morbid fixation with the keywords triggering you into an untimely calamity of horrific resplendence. Fuck. Whore. Death. A small girl in thigh-high tights flashes her vagina in an inconsequential display of voyeurism. It is class. You are class. Glittering in the cerulean madness restraining your craving for quantum initiation. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of Vaseline warfare, keeping your brain intact through a stunted phase of disrepair. A need. A requirement. A lethargic reminder of your own existence, as you enclave your mind in an overwhelming bombardment of obscene destitution. Then begins the rape. The Lithuanian chokeholds. The brutality of forced-torture and poly-amorous anthropomorphism, tossed into the sweaty paws of a paedophile in a furry suit, designed to fit enough disenfranchised cocks to murder a small horse. Orphaned children dying in a fledgling fuck-storm of medical disaster, fists shoved so deep into so many unrecognisable tight spaces that not even the coroner can keep up. This was life, and life was me. We were one, so go run free.

The vintage oak dining table, a testament to slave craftmanship, reached out towards a broken family of none. The helper sat with his ankles tied in a handcuff knot of submissive apprehension, agitated in the scars he picked from his face in an imperfect spiral of manic indecisive. His long fingers tenderly curled, clutching a pair of chopsticks which bore the word 'slave' in traditional Chinese. I didn't know what to say to him in the linger of conversation, other than to shrewdly poke my eyes at the way he would sneak ounces of snuff into his gums, as he began to yearn in a smitten barm of deranged twitching. The confidence in his eyes, haemorrhaging  Drano by the trench full. It wasn't safe to be around.

"Why you not help bring food to table?"

"Alright, calm down."

"Don't tell me to calm down! I am your mother! Now you go get food!"

Carrying back a bowl of rice, rested below a mixed variety of dried fish and roasted porcupine, sat my demeanour for a second time at the table, next to the helper, now passed out in a nicotine mist of hoarfrost. The pickling cabbage and black bean sauce slurry, laden with enough dehydrated corn flour to kill a small child. Patiently waiting for mother to arrive. Then she sits. And we eat. And not a word more was said, nor could be predicted by the harrowing radars of the north seas, commissioned to detect even the slightest hint of judgement from the cadaverous woman of cree. The rice entered my mouth, stewing inside my gums. Tumbling against my tastebuds. Learning how best to cope with the excessive salts and sours besieging my tongue. Enveloping into an ulcer of dyspeptic saturation, as I continued to sit there in a spire of modern arcadia, mind prefixed on grabbing mother's face and shredding it along the brick wall outside. Usually, we didn't speak. The only time we spoke was when we argued about something, usually so she could tell me off or criticise me for not being more like her. Just what every son wants to hear.

Admittedly, I didn't know a lot about my father. He was more of a blur, than a curiosity. A seismic event which brought about my creation, that never really amounted to anything beyond day zero. A constant scapegoat for all my failures. I suppose it never really bothered me a great deal. It's hard to bother about something that's not there. No one to blame. No one to praise. A bad meal at a pub at Wednesday prices. A Madonna print without a genuine signature. Rather, I was my own father. My own role model. My own piece of shit to be moulded into a Cambridge English Dictionary of hysteric approximations, to be sold at fire sale prices to people who barely understand the value of language. Epithet. You. Shall.

"You need to find a partner! When you find partner!?", she blurts, fish-bone stuck between her two front teeth. Awaiting some kind of lengthy apology for my existence.

"I don't know," was how I usually responded to her antics. In most cases, I simply tried my best to transpose her complaints into a stream of white noise. Chequered waves of tampered dystopia, leaving my mind as quickly as they had entered. in spite of my rapid-set cynicism, I'd always carried a sense of hope that one day she would change, and experience some sort of miasma of clarity that would completely flush her brain, and allow her to truly understand how to severely unfuck the caged dwadiness of her own insanity. Instead, her mind seemed more liked a hotpot of shrapnel, forever combusting into ever-smaller pieces that would eventually seep into the insides of her lungs, and cause her to gaff in a choking fit of hardened-cum and arsenal currency exchange.

Then it hit me. The epiphany. The realisation. The stature. There I was. Suspended in time. My vision as plain as it had been since the onset of my birth. The rise of empowerment. The shore of distaste. Who even was this women, and who was I to put up with her garish games? What power did she have over me, other than the common title which she spruiked in confine and maxim? What resulted was an inescapable pocket of caked emotion, tumbling and forming under the tipsy dissonance of dichotomist refactor. Fraught with relegation, reorganising itself at even the slightest hint of opposition. The beat-down was real and I was ready to represent.

"Do you not care!? Why are you so stupid!?" I couldn't take it anymore. The sound of her voice. The nature of her everything. I was going to do it. My gosh, I was actually going to do it, and for the first time in life, I was absolutely dying to see how she would respond. With an ecstatic grin, I stand up from my chair, point my finger at her face, and I tell her to go fuck herself.

"Go fuck yourself," I shout.

It was the kind of statement which reverberated through the air, knocking down the ancient structures of tradition and trust which had been upheld for so long, that no one even quite knew what to do once they were gone. It even woke the helper up from his deep slumber, whom in a terrorised panic, ran towards the pantry and locked himself away in a shivering hiding. The corresponding silence was deafening. She was speechless. Nothing could assist her in rectifying the situation, as she mentally scanned through the millions of backhanded compliments and off-putting phrases awash in her mind. Realising there was nothing within her power which would allow to take control of this situation. She was lost. Buried alive under the height of her arrogance. Confusion which soon defaulted to anger, in a last-ditch attempt to save the empire which she'd fought so hard and for so long to maintain. An iron fist turned to rust. The weight of her ignorance, dissolving around my shoulders and setting me free. And as much as she wanted to scream and shout, the words simply wouldn't come out. A woman no more.

Purple houses. Red parlours. Caricature crackers in an assortment of porous scars. Well sought-after delicacies with mini tasers for appetisers. The frail voice of an American senior approaches an ordinary Chinese housewife, strapped with a yoga mat and an aging bottle of plum sauce. Rubbed in the scent of the raw documents outlining his death will. The perfect aphrodisiac for any immigrant to begin gushing from their vagina in an involuntary orgasm known to kill. Paralysed in a shaking puddle of oriental discharge, eyes quivering beyond the human spectrum, overloaded with ejaculate. Pronounced dead at 8:21pm Dusk. Death from white privilege.

Several cars arrive at an opulent mansion, garden decorated in a topiary mess of yellow dandelions and white pebbles. Tennessee horticulture with a Chinese know-how. A drunken camera crew appear from a grimy meat van, holding a giant metal dildo in the shape of a plastic dragon. Caramelised in an aluminium canvas of scheduled statements and fried pork mince. The family of the Shenzhen Steel Conglomeration were in for a real treat this year, as part of a grand game they liked to call Wild Dragon. A royal competition where the wives of Communist Party leaders were shrouded in red craggy blankets stolen from the deceased bodies of Japanese revolutionaries, to be stretched and fucked with a symbolic dildo in the shape of an imperial dragon. And those that survived the 8-foot long beast would be crowned General Secretary of their local party branch, with the ornament to be permanently lodged inside their vagina, forever bleed under the auspices of greed. The civility was bare, and the dragon was strong, although I doubt they could have ever imagined it any other way.

Although I could feel myself gasping at the recklessness of my actions, lightheaded and without due, there was also something quite serene about the way my vision blurred with the tears in my eyes. Blinding me in a calm tingle of persistent, which to this day, has never quite left me. The suburban-bound train forced itself along its motionless tracks, facilitating my barren attempt to simply shut down and remove myself from the world. Was I bad person? Did I even have a choice? It felt as if I was part of some kind of definitive cycle of madness, a recipient of psychopaths and manipulative low-lives, born out of a never-ending chain of bad parenting and dialectic abuse. I guess everyone wants to be 'the one' who breaks the cycle, and today was either an ill-fated deterministic attempt at sealing my own genes into a house boat of future divorce, or I was going to truly make it as a human reincarnation of the guilt which pervaded my blood-line for thousands, upon thousands of years.

I receive a text in broken English, lamenting her feelings. I delete it in anger, and yet the anger is too much. I close my laptop and break down in a tidal wave of emotion. Perhaps the lady sitting in front of me would be so kind as to offer her hand in sex, as we gently made love to each other in a sobbing pile of gleep. More realistically, she would continue to sit there, awkward at the attention I was drawing, before sending an unremorseful text to her partner about how unbearable her situation was, suggesting that they order pizza tonight to cope with the ramifications. For now it was just me and this brightly-lit space, alone in the repetition of my stomach seizing up and my nose feeling like a leaky tap of foreign medical waste. Now trapped inside my senses. I had tasted what it was like to be free.
