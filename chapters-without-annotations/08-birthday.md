# birthday.
<!--

A week of life passes by. The rain runs thin. My hair mauves dry. The work dulls. Today is my birthday. The loneliest day of the year. Crust upon the gallows, I seized to clamour out of my mother's heinous vagina, intent on working a dead end job cold-calling the elderly for the debt in their graves. It was an empty echo-chamber of must-haves and has-beens; slurry in a deceit of exacerbated euphony. Grace upon the impression of a fuck-off grin. Mute is thy safeword. Desperate is thy plea.

I often wondered what a birthday was, aside from an excuse to feel lonely about one's existence. Statutory in its permission to congeal, like a cookie stolen from childhood by the teetering hands of a rabid adult. Ripped from your soul n' dipped in the pity of its macabre jealousy. Megalomaniac in its savage. Crave is its transpire. As you sit there in the unmaintained parking lot of an untenable KFC, face like a fat cunt, chokin' on a bucket o' chicken you found next to the decomposing corpse of a pigeon's corroding interior. Dipped in a potato n' gravy so thick, that it emulsifies your organs into a disintegrating stew. Ripe for the swollen lips of a hardened porn-addict, with a wet sock for a mother n' a tampon for a bandaid. For ol' times sake, buck-aroo. 

I grouch out of bed. It's 10:35am. I receive a text from my mother. That bitch. The feeling is immense. That fucking bitch. A trove of anger overcomes me. Aggravating my emotions to swirl in tandem around the big ball of fire calculating thought into a bucket of crimson anarchy. A twitch of self-harm emerges. Grabbing me by the throat in a violent slam of mottled indigo, now caught in a whirlwind of fervent aggression. Rage. Predominantly I felt rage from the indignation which burst from my infuriation with the FÃ¼hrer itself. The kind of anger which inevitably evolves into a catastrophic cuss of doth and cower. I block her number. It's just how I cope.

It's now 10:45am. I'm not feeling so lucky. My life has been paired with an unmatched sense of sadness, as it grows organically out of my lungs and into the outer-reaches of the world. Search for any semblance of joy. Enveloping my body in a web of decaying atrophy. Teaching me silence. Guiding me towards poorest undersurface of a

 These words are the only thing keeping me from vomitting all over the linen.

The time is 11:00am. I don't quite know what to make of the saturated bowl of strewn wheat in front of me. The tasteless slop congealed muck at the bottom of the food pyramid. I can feel the echo in my heart. The yearning which whispers your name

Maybe I was feeling lucky this morning.

Saturday morning. Sunday autopsy. Duck-taped to the underside of my desk, I vainly attempt to rip the pistol from the fragmented clumps of dust underlying the trigger, pointing the barrel of the gun at my head. I can feel it sneeze. Manic in its worry. I cry. I whimper. I breathe. I scream. I sustain it. I scream so loud I can feel my throat polymerise blood into tracks of . Ears turning a bright purple. My finger slips, and I am interrupted. "Shut the fuck up!" my neighbour shouts from across the hall, furious at the relative loss of peace my existence has caused to their regular programming. I put the gun down and continue to stare at the wall in front of me, splintered in the flakes of white gloss peeling in the isolated sections of my unjustified desire to live. The doorbell rings. It's my friend. It's my birthday. I just want to die.

"Show us some cleavage, honey," boasts the man at the door, holding a half opened-can of Guinness n' poorly wrapped . A suitable greeting for this 27 year old writer, dressed in yesterday's t-shirt. A stain on this earth to be admonished in ever diminishing quantities, sunken without Christ. His coarse facial hair brushes against my cheek as he dives in for a hug.

The doorbell rings again. It's Milo. Queen Bee. I race to the door in a rush of excitement, bumping my knee on a bookshelf full of Victorian classics. Surely it made girls wet.

The boob and the sex-queen sat together on the couch opposing, trying to figure out exactly how they fit into this scenario. Was he the child-abuser that he constantly referenced at work? Had they fucked at one point? Why was her hand on my leg?

The driver was a bit of a fuckin' winky. I'm allowed to call him a winky on my Birthday, right? A

You could tell he was having  . I noted not to shake his hand.

The driver spoke three different languages. Japanese, Chinese and Korean.

If I could fuck any emotion I would fuck sadness. It would be your most malleable best friend. It wouldn't care if you beat it, raped it or crushed into a thousand tiny pieces. It would persist in its grief, elated in the distress it had already come to expect of itself. Grateful in your neediness and desperate in your pleasure. It is what Gods come to expect of their young.

The Mexican restaurant made its home within the matchwood interiors of a refurbished Church, house to slurry of canned beans and quarter-ounce jars

The enchilada. An inoffensive mound of maize-infused goop, seared in a second-hand microwave oven on finance. The slosh hammock rolled around on my plate, mummified in a meat-cheese mixture of re-hydrated pus and freeze-dried caesin. A product they used to call 'vinyl chloride' back at the foundry.

Hid behind my over-sized sombrero, the streaming lights of the 8pm disco-ball.

I sat back at my desk.

Ah, fuck therapy.
