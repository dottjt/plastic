# life.




Welcome to life. A rancid fascination of all things particular. An overwhelming sense of asymptotic reference. America's rag-doll daddy of putty intentions, spluttered viscous into the cultural misappropriation you slowly witness before your very eyes. This is where all stories begin, end and...

"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room, as he swivels in his chair towards my general direction. Hesitant in a gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, his deflated stature struck brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares. Only crumbs were left of the star-mangled biscuits, presumably store-bought for our excited listeners at home. He was the heartless operator who would introduce himself as my only lifeline into the world of publishing, and I was the incompatible liar who intended to milk his acquaintance until his bare nipples ran raw.

"I really, really liked what you did there. I thought it was simply fantastic! The imagery. The sex appeal. I could definitely fuck that, if you know what I mean."

Naturally, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. Was it a generous expression of misplaced animosity? Was it the beginning of what was to become a laborious online prank, where I, the unwitting idiot, were to be exposed as some part-time celebrity on a popular Japanese game show? Perhaps it was the result of a fatherless upbringing, rushed in an environment full of conservative vice-chancellors from the backwaters of a clandestine women's society, keen on beating the fluff out of potato to prove it's self-worth in the inter-continental submission of 3rd world delight. Sure, I'd probably fuck it too. Me and my words, dressed in mortal calamity, blind in an unfortunate sexual encounter involving my last moments in an exploding orgasm, and a terribly shy lackey with an exotic syllable for a grin.

Although I suppose it was the level of respect I garnered as an unknown assailant, possibly attached to his meaningless gestures delivered haphazardly like the illegitimate leader of an unknown guerilla war. Che guevara au lite, the raved lunatic of a ritual patriarchal circle-jerk, head o' the New and Improved Mickey Mouse Club, accent dripped-thick in the ancient tar of a dead Italian laid limp over his heartless sleeves and into the repeating glares of purgatory. A cursory monument in time where real estate agents and car salesmen devised schemes to enumerate the poor. He was a man reassured by the might and mercy of a three-hour Tony Robbins lecture once witnessed in full three-minute summary, basked in a level of self-gratification not last seen since the Holy Roman Empire. Then across the border, intrepid behind an facade of U.N. sponsored barbed-wire and a conundrum of dolly-cash, sitting awkwardly by the wayside in an enclosure of false attitudes and echoing dialogue was me. An unruly clash against the unsettling intentions revealing themselves in the feint colonies of pop-sweat rippling through the arcade of my skin. I couldn't have been more uncomfortable, nor under-represented in this fraudulent battering of intellectual deceit, but I assured myself that everything would be okay as long as I continued to embrace the sodomy in full. Thankfully, Aristotle was blasphemous.

"You know, have you ever considered writing this, uh, material into a book? I think it would make for fascinating reading."

"Well yeah, that's basically why I'm here. To get my book published," sat an audaciously sad man preoccupied firmly in this chair, helplessly situated in the mire of time, conveniently puzzled at the present-day theatrics of this man's somewhat infectious outreach. The corduous stench which leaked from the mangled pipes from within the ceiling above provided a welcome blessing to the establishment of incredulous publishing, thankfully contained within the four walls of this room. The curse and downfall of a 70s' decor filled to the brim with unwashed tupperware and plastic varnish, tainted by the sickly yellow synthesis oozing itself from a congregation of fake plants situated on a lonely shelf to the north, and into decrepit the atmosphere of the dimly lit room. Providing just enough grim to keep the magic of creativity from harming anyone.

Soon an entire lifetime of smalltalk and faux pleasantries would transpire in my head, capturing me in arrival at Dante's fuck-pen of ill-conceived ecstasy. And in the wisp that followed from the dry words nailing my jaw to hardwood floors below, it genuinely felt as if we were getting nowhere. He wanted to see himself in everything, and I simply wanted to be acknowledged, loved and possibly adjourned like a house cat on trial for dragging a dead, mutilated creature into the house during a heated game of Friday night football.

Catching him off guard, now that I was fully disinterested in anything he had to say, I decided to reach for the mug o' water conveniently placed next to the picture of a scantily-dressed child in tight cheerleader's seduce, presumably to have the words "Daddy's girl" tattooed on her forehead before being fucked in front of an eager camera-crew and a live internet audience of millions. Yakuza's finest. And as the lukewarm liquid trickled down my throat, even my basic bodily functions could sense the paltry desperation of this poor man's attempt at azure, developing itself into the middle-aged caricature of a homeless veteran deep-throating his prized roadkill for the thrill of the violence. His deadbeat practice. The filament of gore that shone like a piercing light through his frail heart. At one point, I was convinced he was trying to sell me a phone plan, subtle in the dubious hints of unintelligible sign language his fingers deliberated. Outweighing all logical possibility, I attempted to let out a deep sigh before bringing my smile to a full, unmatched forte.

"It's fast approaching twelve and I'd kill for a bite. You like Chinese? You're Chinese, right? I mean, you just have that slight gook look to you, no offense, cutter." Sure. Nothing offensive about wish-washing the unadulterated scum out of my life. You pantomime sack of shit. I've scraped less-abrasive gunk from the self-mutilated pussy of a dead-hooker's final stand at a crack-clinic shootout than I've spent today hearing you mutter two-ounces of garbage into the lexical sinkhole you're now created. Ah, who even cares anymore. I'm sure his wanton style was just the kind of tautological caprice required to turns heads and kick books off shelves and into the wounded hands of today's consumer. The kind of frolic that apparently, readers desperately want to fuck.



Attempting to leave the office was a frivolous scruffle of hard tactics and self-determination, even more so than my initial struggle to weasel myself into the world of publishing. Between wades of paper stacked chronologically in ways that would leave a physically handicapped man in existential crisis, and what seemed like a fossilized pocket of methane from the Mesozoic period, left only enough oxygen in a tightly-concealed vacuum of quantum necessity, designed cunningly for the efficient gills of literary agents and art critics. Begging me in drape tones, like a Catholic choir of desperate school children, the scattered array of stationary and clutter surrounded me in a wildfire of nomadic appeal, begging me to stay and offer my soul to the lord of decor sitting idly by in frizzled drab tones. From the cruft flower wallpaper, to the reoccurring stains which revealed themselves as Tommy and Russ, nothing felt untarnished, nor logically brave in this maze of recollection. Even the mould in the dark corners of the room had gained somewhat of a celebrity status, stacked with old writer's manuscripts from the Dreamtime. A haughty Machiavellian ruse, the editor put it, as he guided me out through the large indecent apertures of 136 Brightridge Avenue. Following what seemed like an eternity, it was nice to once again reacquaint myself with the smack, shovel and swing of these mean city streets.



I suppose Chinatown is the same everywhere you go. Unadorned paper lanterns slathered in the embrace of inner-city smog, conveniently branded red, gold and yellow in a slurry of interdependent conceit. A mass-produced line of quasi-communistic spirit, shoved senseless within an ornate red envelope branded with symbols of luck and whore, conveniently placed within arm's distance of a burnt-out firecracker and an unsteady hit of Fentanyl, ready to sell or consume. Surely, an ancient mechanism designed to forget and impress, because as any good Chinese man knows, family always comes first, and when your dying relative collapses at your knees, vomiting coagulated semen in a patriotic display of sex and fervour. That's when you know you've made it.

Colorful displays of neon lights and piccadilly extravagance shrouded the back draw of the twisted forgotten lanes harbouring The Town, leading us discretely towards our destination of food and patched slavery. And the more we squabbled in polarising ferverence, the more we assimilated into the smells, riches and eventual homeostasis of local chicken stock, plagued weary with the granularity of Grandpa's cigarette ash, fresh from the noodle shop next door ...or was it grasping me from the sewer below, astew with soiled ginger shavings, discarded opium and an unidentifiable delicacy designed only for the fine China stolen by generation's past. Thankfully, we were only one last meal away from finding out, as our view widened and our sense of place vanished into a cold dark room of orbital apprehension. Our adventure had only just begun.

"I too wanted to become a writer once," the editor blurted, as if making some kind of ultimate sacrifice against his own will to speak, pushing his way through the plastic beads designed to keep foreigners out.

"But I figured the money was better on the other side of the fence. You know, where the prairie sits. The prairie, dude! I'm absolutely killin' it with these metaphors!"



The dull eggshell greys on the dilapidated walls of the Chinese outlook (suitably named, The Ming) drew a sense of brooding as I stepped through the battered corridor and into the bright fluorescent glaze of an oriental mental ward, padded with the comestible muck of a harmless flammable odour used solely for manufacturing purposes. The laminate rows of chair and table confounded the general sense of space it was attempting to inhabit, juxtaposed against the depleted faces of a trodden theatre affair, now racing frantically eradicate all sense of honorable atmosphere as part of a grand, self-serving pursuit of cathartic, emotional absolution. Only time would reveal the truth of the reality we were witnessing here today, hinted by the shockingly empty response our waiter deposited, as she guided us to our booth at the back far corner of the asylum.

The booth itself comfortably sat three, an necessary arrangement to comfortably situate the Editor's ego, driven mad by the delicate tension of an unforgiving racist and his gook-inspired raciee. He of course insisted on sitting on the cushioned fabric below, because apparently even the thought of asking for my opinion was simply too much to conflate. Take, steal and murder at any cost, no matter what the injury or crime, and be sure to gather the receipt come tax time to assure your place on Mr. Ming's throne. Perhaps it was simple American policy to be an asshole. In fact, I was almost certain of it.

"Listen, I know you think I'm not the BRIGHTEST guy, but you know, I'm more a connections kind of man. A Wowser. Fantastic bloody connections, I'd say" the editor remarked, unintentionally resolute in the valium-infused confines of a sedated cliche.

"So do you like the book?" I retorted, keen to hear what misaligned innocence could be extracted from the two useless lumps of flesh surrounding his open-closey thingy. At this stage I'd doubted whether he even had the capacity to read at all, as he confidently placed his hands behind his head, nearly knocking over a priceless Qing dynasty vase. It was like witnessing a stray deer run from it's prey, gasping at it's lungs in residual safety, only to be shot in the head by a lone ranger with far too much time on his hands. All in a day's work.

"I think it has potential, kid," who in a momentary relapse of bad faith, revealed himself as an incapacitated five-year-old before snapping back into his adult form, remaining cautiously silent as per the contract he'd maintained with the five mile dead-zone preoccupying his brain.

"Although I have to say, just between you and me, some of the things you write about make me feel real uneasy. Like, what the hell even is a 'putty intention'? Is it some weird sexual thing, because you know I steer clear of that weird stuff."

"I mean, I gue..."

"Hey, waiter! Where are the dumps at! Yo. I'm just kidding, although I would really appreciate a fresh menu. This one smells like chicken grease. Oh, and two seltzer waters please! It's like I'm tryin' throat-fuck a sauna in here." Only he would have the audacity to confuse verbal harassment for the outline of excellent customer service. He even insisted that the waiter stand silently by on some kind of overtime distress call, as he scanned through the menu with the hobbling glower of a dying senior.

"Let's see. I will have the 6-piece pork dumpling set, a chicken n' corn soup and uhh, could I please also have a serving of Singapore noodles. They're real Singapore noodles, right?"

The waiter, the holy accolade of Mr. Ming himself, exercised a compendium of boredom in the broken English she repeated in direct contempt of the editor's culinary sacrilege which trod on a level of disrespect and treachery that transcended almost all cultural and social boundaries. Certainly, I doubt the restaurant owners enjoyed their daughter being harassed by a mid-aged white sock, an over-worked Mr. Ming caught standing in the corner of the ward, cautiously eyeing his customers and their presence, to the deep sighs of a sous-chef cutting slabs of a pork into thinly-sliced bundles of coy. Noodle in. Noodle out. Break a hand and shut the fuck up. I was ready to order.

"I think I'll have the..."

"So junior, tell me about this book then. Are we talkin' fantasy? I mean, I don't remember readin' about no goblins or nuthin', but it seems a bit out there if you know what I mean," muttered the editor mid prawn cracker, as he threw his menu onto the table beside him, completely unaware that I had yet to order anything from Mr. Ming's consortium of unidentified protein products. At this point I was equally as hungry as I was keen to have him tied to a bench and water tortured, although realising my cake had already been spat, trampled and fuck on, it was clear misery module located conveniently via in a slot in my skull had already suppressed my appetite, now programmed to endure whatever existing attrition was being held against my soul.

"I suppose I would describe it as story which takes you through the thoughts and interactions of a character who violently degrades to a point of complete destitution," I answered, ready to endure a concise refraction of meaningless assault.

"You know I don't do fantasy, right? That sounds like some weird Tolkein shit. You know, I'm all about the human story. I'm a man of feeling and I love hot integrity pieces."

For sparse moment we both stared at each other, like two brothers who hadn't quite met before. Although we both knew what we wanted, maybe we'd reached a point of where we were both too old to truly understand each other. At the very least, I knew that I'd had enough of his antics and aside from literally grabbing my spoon and shoving it into his eye before skull-fucking him, I squeezed my lips and held on tightly to the anger and frustration that was desperately trying to release itself into the world.

"I don't think this is going to work out," I murmured, hand on my bag, ready to engage in a prison-break of fury, only to be interrupted by the waiter carrying plates full of hot, steaming food, fresh from the packet. And although it clearly felt like a bad-date gone worse, it also felt a bit like a bad break up, between yin and yang's relative domains. For a few moments he sat there, perhaps overcome by his own  crushing morality, confused by today's outcome. In fact, I'm not quite sure how he felt, as he sat there in relative silence, breaking into his Singapore noodles and gobbling up the rasher twins' lesser cousins, in an all-out homicide of culinary scorched-earth. All I knew was that the mood had soured and something vulnerable had touched his inner-human, as he broke down sobbing into the billowing steam of oyster-sauce particulate and inconsequential urine.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry," he said, with bits of noodle stuck to his face, like a child's mural gone horribly wrong.

"I need this job. I really fucking do. Fuck. I'm on last strings buddy. You don't know how badly I need this. They're going to fire me, I know it, unless if I can... I promise I'll try harder, okay!?" As far as I was concerned, it wasn't a matter of effort, so much as it was a matter of incompatibility, and although he knew it too, I wasn't keen on teaching a dead dog new tricks. The plain insincerity on the walls, now shifting it's muted colours into a dark purple, served as a sore reminder not to address the poor yupie trying his best to remain sober on a Wednesday.

"I just don't think you get it," carried the words into the hollow cavern of his brain, now attempting to recruit a gallow of well-trained monkeys to decipher the ploy of sabotage being hurled his way. The mean man of intellectual steel, burning himself on



It's almost as if you didn't even read the book,

"What, are you calling me stupid?" retorted the Italian barbarism he sought as a defensive mechanism against all means of life.

"Does it even make a difference?"

At this point, I was certain he'd finally crumble and return back into the pit of magma from which he formed. Scheming in delicate ways

"What if I told you that


The cheque came squalid





As walked out of the Ming restaurant, indifferent to these grease-ridden lanes, plastered many times over with a volcanic certainty of cheap glue and holographic print, all I could feel were the tip of my knees as they sank ever-so silently into the mound of my socks. Like a slow-tide of faithlessness being dragged back into reef, it was the kind of thing that would always unanimously end in a public cheer of despondence, gurgled in the mass-hysteria of the death of an enemy.







# work.




In work we trust. A plutocratic orgy of totalitarian devastation, heiled as this week's perfect solution to the rampant "black" problem imprint to the segregation our society loves to weep. Mesmerisingly subterranean, it is the sensitive folly of a scheme designed to reprogram you into an undying commitment of useful, well-behaved utility. Shuckle up, bucko. It's time to cradle the flair.

Following this morning's disastrous ousting with the editor, I was truly in no mood to sort paper, snort wafer, nor entertain my manager with my two-time tap-plastic beat. What I truly wanted was a gun and a live-animal to contest with, as I repeatedly express my debilitating sorrow and uncompromising vision by emptying entire cartridge of .55 bullets into the head of a docile four-legged creature. Preferably in front of it's own fawn. It's dead carcass will then to be held by it's ears and kissed with an intense fervour, as I grin awkwardly into the sun to be captured in photographic memory for future generations to inspire and idealise. I was going to make it work.

"Fuck. I forgot to bring my pass." I realised to myself, as I stood near the immaculate glass doors barring me from entry, reeking of the emulsified pork and clive I didn't get a chance to eat. Ah, yes. Work truly is the kind of dibble-dabble affair that dribbles you in the nonsensical pleasure of well-organised crime, lesser to the pagan beliefs you uphold as gospel upon God's almighty vision. A mechanical duet featuring your absolute best face in an air-tight vacuum of complete perfection, mired upon a palette of plastic purple laminate, suitably moulded into tiny matchsticks for your mouth to align. "Half a matchstick each day keeps ol' Maggie away from caressing the heart monitor!", murmurs my agent, somewhat delirious in her intentions.

At least all of this would hold true if the dreaded excess of work didn't also lead to an almost debilitating level of self-harm, like a compulsive desire to voluntarily gouge your eyes out with the edge of a disposable plastic knife left ever-so keenly on the office kitchen table as a symbol of 21st century martyr, in the duty of extreme stress. Delegated ever-so softly as a personality disorder with just the right amount of jazz to keep the leadership in a-buzz. It's an exciting state of premonition, as your father dies in front of you, and then again in full motion as re-enacted by a man in green suit to be retrofitted within a scene in Top Gun, his favourite film.

"I'm guessing you forgot your pass again," approaches a cheerful voice from the wide open carpark leading to the building.

"I guess I have indeed," I respond, slightly enamoured with her presence.

"Hey, did you hear about the updated deadlines? I swear, it changes daily," Milo remarked, dispassionate at the seams in a flurry of untied hair and a penchant

"I have no idea," I responded, intense in my desire to remove myself from her presence. I mean, it's not like I hated her or anything. In actual fact I couldn't stop thinking about her. Those piercing Armenian eyes, wrapped thick in the shrill curls of a maniac-saviour. Her body as slender and as elusive as time itself, emancipated in a . I'm sure she derived pleasure from drenching her lovers in coarse honey, twisting them in all sorts of tantilisingly sweet ways, before checking into rehab for a casual-fuck with the receptionist. She was the girl I wanted,

Yet it was a painful distraction from the thousands of clammy decisions grabbing at my brain and fuck me, but who am I not in love with these days? Yes, an enticingly offensive remark considering the integrity of these tight, syncratic lips. Beauty in their form and sour in their unreckoning desire to force grace into the tiny, dopamine-sized pockets preoccupying your brains. Pour the brandy into thy castle and deliver thy swine from the depths of hell. Oh, ever-so hellish indeed.

The bright industrial lights were designed to impress,

"Well, it's a bit ridiculous, don't you think. I'm going out for a fag, do you want one?"

"You know I don't smoke."

"I saw your drunk at last year's Christmas party buddy, flinging yourself around like a desperate chimney to quench your addiction," as she walked out of the room and into the foyer, her petite silhouette causing all sorts of mischievous in my mind, as I followed her out in dire need of a cigarette. Women really are the worst.

"Ah, well, well, my child. It looks like the fatal grape has followed this hasty speed," passing me the pouch as she retrieved the filters from her purse.

Casual smoking.

"So, how did le meeting with the editor go?"

"I really don't know, to be quite honest. He's a bit of a nut-job,


"Do you ever think about death."



I actually quite like work, and aside from literally being paid by the boat-load to make that outrageous statement, I genuinely think it's a perfect package of routine and marriage. A homeless mother which holds you dearly and maintains such reverence towards your new-found illness of being a cute millennial, that you really can't help but wonder how you deliberate any sort of significant meaning, beyond the corpse you just laid to rest with a blunt knife and a resolve to inflict meaningless revenge. It is a true sense of purpose to wake up at 5:20am in the morning, only to disappoint yourself later in an attempt to pry the concrete from your eyes using a miniature-sized pickaxe.

It's leverage, silly. That's what keeps your heart young and your fake eyelashes pretty. I mean, can you even taste the salt in the air? It's everywhere. In my eyes. My lungs, oh those poor little lungs of mine. It's a bit like trying to breathe without the glamour of knowing where exactly the oxygen is coming from. Perhaps that's just how we do it here in Cattle Country, remise to the steak you gorge on and hoard. An excellent place to adore, as well as ignore, all kinds of pertinent squalor; the same kind you so profess as professional gold. Your rough heart creates many.

"Take this poor women and guide her towards the top of patriarchy," gleams an overly-caffeinated man in a company sweater,


It's a beautiful sight, as I gaze out into the foray of wild desks and fibre glass upholstry shimmering in the distance. You might even consider it a blessing of sorts, a weary collection of long-term aptitude, projecting itself across the the many faces of

Crinkle n' cut, Benny boy. It's time to solder those wounds shut and call it a day. I know that's exactly how our good friend Jesus would want it. Recuperated within the space of a 10 minute smoko which clearly got waaaayyy out of hand. Keep the change sucker. It's all on me.


Milo returned with a coffee and a grin. Two things I've never seen her without.




I fingered through my manuscript.


# family.




A sperm is all it takes a to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the Pseudoephedrine encapsulated collaborations causing you to screech in hallowing pleasure at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in post-war self-abuse and the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes and valid and fully-funded by the Catholic cum delegation and their pack of Irish henchmen. And yet the great thing about lust is that your odds increase dramatically the more biological dice you decide to roll. For an almost inconspicuous price of admission, an entire hoard of sperm is all it takes to push and pull our beautiful fuck-thing through at least the early phases of college, as our dashing pre-star surrounds herself by a pack of anxious young men, pumped full of imitation testosterone and a natural tendency for knucklehead behaviour. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea inspired holes designed only to generously fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between lit lectures.

"One day I'll have a piece of this," I remarked to myself, as I stared out of the train window into the rolling hills of splendor, surrounded by the lush green crust which upholds the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options breathing life into the thick insoluble clay leeching industrial minerals, begins the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by the flimsy housewives wearing $5 cardigans made of refined polyester. Monstrous structures built from Chinese Communist Party exuberance, host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, taint to the mistress currently tying your illegible wife to a makeshift torture device firing holy incense into her vagina. The artificial lakes and sprawling villages, thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, quietly moaning future generations into a frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.



Admittedly I wasn't particularly keen to see my mother, if you could even call her that. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap, her most prominent features smeared and plastered onto the mummified child of a deep-frozen tibetan whore, operational only in the sheer amount of maintenance required to prevent the awful stench of Bamboo cookware and dried seafood

No shady cum-ridden hand to shake in a confined petrol station restroom, just to witness your first set of fake breasts.

I remember participating in my first gang-bang at 12. There I was. Sitting in my chair. Brain enveloped in something magical.

# depression.




"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro rata in cheerless harmony of , as these subversive words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of circular needles and profane blather. Dead unlike the recurved skunk which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides knurled quandary grasping at it's toes, sneaking itself scalloped into the vice of our dreams in a cheeky attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of ethically-sourced nuts. Victorian times, oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the feint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, sweetie? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the edge of your heart so you can satirise my maltreatment!?"

I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another drink of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of my mind, withdrawing my arrival from the world in a sudden snap of attention, embarking my riches into the fabulous nooks and crannies of insecurity's eroded retreat.

"Yes, sour grapes make a chaffy treat," as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pit-patter of the Persian rug below. A delicate spine hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp, cold walls supporting it's fine trepidation into literary foray. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing, something brewing in my mind, infecting my neurons with an uncanny chatter - musing over the wrinkles and follicles leeching from my face and into my skin. It's apparent there's trouble, a whole defeated sunk of loss and perish, because this man is afraid. He is afraid of the thought and the orient. He is afraid of the man that is himself, unrecognisable in his own blood and flesh. And yet he lies, because he is afraid. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. Alone in my room, perched at the end of my bed, was this surreal emptiness that could not be reasoned with. It was subtle, mired in vanishing falseness, like a passing moment through the vastness of open space. Yet it's ever-reaching permissiveness offered a kind of genuine refuge which could not be argued with, like it served to teach you something sanctimonious about very foundations of life itself. "Come with me," it whispers, holding your hand like an innocent child showing guiding you through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all an alluring premise with a quaint pinch of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, which these words disguise as a romantic escapade into cannular reverberations these ears yearn to share.

"What am I doing," I wonder, depleted in the struggle of my confusion. The gristle on my chin scrapes against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my disenchantment with the world. I look up from the below the covers and into the indicator of my youth. 10:20am. That can't be good for the kidneys. Merged like oxidised gum to a bench at the train station,

I don't quite know what's going on right now, however I feel quaint.

I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull roundness.
"Don't fall off the train," they said. 

"It only comes once every two years, so unless if you're willing to choo, choo, choo - you better know your place, or be culled." 

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. 

Fuck you rabbit. Fuck you indeed.






# therapy.




Everyone dreams. It's on the front cover of every magazine, sizing and measuring you down to the retrofit standard that is printed at birth, stuck on your forehead and published to the nearest data collection centre, to be processed under the fine eye of a complex Japanese algorithm written in comparative lisp. "You are an average male, with an overwhelming propensity for sticking your penis into pretentious white people," my label states, time-stamped in a beautiful Iranian font, extracted from the seminal texts of a contemporary guide to desktop publishing. We try to love ourselves. We try to breathe meaning into our pursuits and leisures, providing them with hope and transparent textures to decorate our lives with, only to see them absorbed by a plague of locusts completing their regular routine around your ego.

"The problem was that I don't feel successful," I uttered to the therapist, a cold shoulder of taut one-liners and intricately gross examinations which bordered on dyslexic. A siamese bucket of discarded tape recorders, patched together with the incomplete narratives of hollow young men. She truly was a vacuum of utilitarian comfort, designed to suck the joy and pleasure from basic human necessity, formulised in a haptic frenzy of uncompromising hand gestures and seizure-inducing flashes. Yet, there was something comforting in the brown cardigan which served solely as a dilapidated corkboard of cat hair and coffee stains. Truth is I'd always wanted to fuck my therapist. Actually it was fair to say that I was keen to fuck anything.

"Well, what's your idea of success?" the therapist responded.

"I don't know. Maybe it's having sex three times a week. Owning a home. I just don't feel successful," I said, as I dipped my face into my coffee cup like a stubborn penguin. In actual fact my dream was to become a writer. I'm not quite sure when the obsession began, but it was an all-consuming affair with my imagination. An innocent ploy for self-discovery, held in sanctuary by

"What do you think success would feel like?"

"I guess I would be happy. Possibly content and fulfilled with myself, like if felt a sense of confidence and pride in who I was," I said.

"And do you think you would it's possible to feel those things without success?" Fucking bitch. She had me. I knew she fuckin' had me, as the tight-lipped dryness in her eyes protruded like a telescopic rape device. I should have sued the bitch while I had the chance. I knew it wasn't a complete waste of time

"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe it is possible to be happy without chasing my ideas of success. But what point is being happy if you're not successful?" Certainly, I was doubtful she pleased to deal with my inane bullshit on a Friday at 10am, as she pondered the state of her frozen eggs, suspended in a vat of pickle-juice to be extracted once her online dating profile came to full fruition. "Only a matter of time now," she would utter to herself in a fiendish tone, waiting patiently to ensnare her personal toy-boy to be kept and pleasured. Although perhaps that was just her job.

"Well, what's the point of being successful if you're not happy? It sounds like you're not quite sure what it is you want. You view success as a list of objectives to complete, that you also seem to conflate with how you think it will make you feel." she said.

"So what should I do then? Should I just buy the kool-aid and just pursue mindless pleasures instead?"

"I wouldn't go to that extreme. " Truth is, the bitch had no idea what she was talkin' about.




"So would say that you view success as a list of objectives to complete, that you conflate with how you feel?"

"What about being feeling itself? What value do you place on say, happiness?" A finer touch if ever you demanded one, although as we both know, these words are nothing more than a trap our senses are both trying to fight. “It’s okay to burn”, preaches the local glass nun, shouting vast through these pages without even a hint of respite, white powder thick to her heels in a perfect mirage of gloss and so sheen. Ah yes, and just when you thought life’s searing gaze couldn’t get any worse, a talking Harry presents itself in full-fashion and it just doesn’t know when to stop. Shut up Harry. You violent Harry. Fucking Harry. I was sure she was being tart.

"I guess I've never really been happy, and I'm not sure

"Would you say that success and happiness are not the same thing?"




"What about family? Friends?"


"Aren't you going to ask me where Daddy touched me," I said, clearly getting on her nerves.





The orange agent places a sticker on your shoulder, congratulating you for your success, cackling delirious at the charity you demanded in the cusp of your two hands.


There are some with a fantasy to discuss a big-breasted child with a severe OCD for sucking cock.

Surely, in raptum we trust, you silly woman.








"Do you think I'll ever become a successful writer?"

"I'm not sure if that's something I can answer. Although I imagine hard-work can take you a long way towards self-improvement."


Curdled jelly splatters across your face, filling the hollow arteries of your veins with a sense of purpose not know since these words commanded God the pleasure of man. Fabled heroin masqueraded as a cheap 50 cent lice, tasty when chewed. And you know, since we're here to talk about life, let's discuss something more than the stars, the weather or the cookie-cutter commonality which extrudes itself from these dark coarse fabrics currently draping your electric gold. Your brain craves more than just crimson hue, and certainly can afford more than just the tart swine you reach and squander. It’s imperative that we take the excessive plastic off and exercise communication the old-fashioned way, with a gun and a cloud of nicotine vapour designed solely to penetrate your eyes and envelop curiosity in a way which floor would you into compliance.

Given our therapy session has officially begun, I think it’s worth mentioning a few things which I’m sure will help shape our timely discourse. Ultimately, I want you as the reader to take full-view of the Julius Reade TM experience as if you were the great man himself, cast dazzling in perfect tanned bronze upon a height of glory last emanated from the creation of the sun. Looking past the corruption and blatant animal abuse, I think there’s a lot to like about this guy. He lathers his tongue in a motion of self-loathing, and he encourages an agonising torment of indecision, abysmally profound in it's making. The tribe gathers itself around the bounty, thrashing itself about in a sadistic two-time beat. The horrid grin slathers in a ritual known as the hoard, pertain to the long-lasting peace you've always desired. There's a knife on the table and Mr. Compadre sitting across from you has something to say. Let's see who can scream louder.

Certainly, I don't mean to offend you. I mean, don't like to split either, but words are designed to divide and that's precisely what I intend to do. To grab your imagination and divide, mimic and taunt the non-sensical derivative bordering your emotional instability which frankly speaking, should not be touched. Let us for a brief moment become savant together, and share these words without any consideration of the consequences which may ensue. Without any doubt in my mind, this book aims to be tactical in it's abuse and

So let me try and paint you a picture.

You’re a crispy Ted. Your haircut is an impression-less damp scruff of pastiche antiquity. I’ve never quite seen a suit so brown nor flavourless, and yet you have the confidence to match the dull-drudgery holding you down by your neck. A personality devoid of pleasure. Hell, I doubt even your own irony understands itself, let alone comprehends what little you bring to the table, but I tell ya what, it’s real cackle to try and observe you attempt to arrange those i’s and o’s into some kind of logical alphabet soup, glisten to an audience privy to the self-abuse you provide. But the good news is that you’re loved. Yes, Mummy loves you. She craves you. Here’s an expired Campbell’s chicken soup she prepared earlier, even opened the can n’ everything. This soup was crafted with real tears, real buttery tears, the kind of tears only found in upper-market department stores and gold-plated Jewish morgues. The kind of soup that burns your throat and slashes your budget into a miserable low-digit summary. Yet Mummy is in a lot of pain, because you made her pussy bleed and now there’s a frail old lady on the floor, mummified in the nostalgia you once thought intangible. There are scars as thick as knife wounds, carved throughout the maze of willingness you expend



A mature fight-fighter with a body like a well-kept fire axe, covered in the tan ripple of a thoughtless afternoon, fucking your wife by the poolside as you watch by in self-justified shame.


# birthday.




My birthday is the loneliest day of the year. It's an empty echo-chamber of must-haves and has-beens, drowning in a slurry of desperate pleas for love and lace. I often wonder what a birthday message actual is, aside from a fine-grained permission to feel. A pity cookie for old time's sake, just to prove that you haven't been raped and tortured by some Taliban rookie in a silk robe, growing opium from his ranch south of the capital. Glutinous fingers , fiercely bidding for the surface of your attention. Hoping to disperse it's lovely little claws into your spread, violating what little aspiration you have to weed your way back to safety. At first it shrieks in a mad outburst, indicating it's own displeasure with the world. Then it withers into a cloud of mould to suffocate any amount of apprehension from gaining necessary foothold. Lastly it smothers in absolute quantity, absorbing scar tissue and trauma at an incomprehensible rate. And once it's all over, in the snap of a heartbeat, it was as if nothing remained at all. A desolate fire of dementia, swept clean in an enticing devastation of brilliance.

Duck-taped to the underside of my desk, I vainly attempt to rip the pistol from the fragmented clumps of dust underlying the trigger, pointing the barrel of the gun at my head. I can feel it sneeze. Manic in it's worry. I cry. I whimper. I breathe. I scream. I sustain it. I scream so loud I can feel my throat polymerise blood into tracks of . Ears turning a bright purple. My finger slips, and I am interrupted. "Shut the fuck up!" my neighbour shouts from across the hall, furious at the relative loss of peace my existence has caused their Saturday morning. I put the gun down and continue to stare at the wall in front of me, splintered in the flakes of white gloss peeling in the isolated sections of my unjustified desire to live. The doorbell rings. It's my friend. It's my birthday. It's time to shine.

"Show us some cleave, honey," boasts the man at the door, holding a half opened-can of Guinness and . A suitable greeting for this 27 year old writer, dressed in yesterday's t-shirt. A stain on this earth to be admonished in

Have you ever fought the HypeMachine (TM)? It's this high-pitched churn that gathers in the distance, loathing in




The doorbell rings again.





The driver was a bit of a fuckin' winky. I'm allowed to call him a winky on my Birthday, right? You could tell he was having  . I noted not to shake his hand.

The driver spoke three different languages. Japanese, Chinese and Korean.


If I could fuck any emotion I would fuck sadness. It would be your most malleable best friend. It wouldn't care if you beat it, raped it or crushed it's a thousand tiny pieces. It would persist in it's grief, elated in the distress it had already come to expect of itself. Grateful in your neediness and desperate in your pleasure. It is what Gods come to expect of their young.












The Mexican restaurant made it's home within the interior of a refurbished Church, house to slurry of canned beans and quarter-ounce jars

The enchilada rolled around on the plate, mummified in a meat-cheese mixture of re-hydrated pus and freeze-dried caesin. A product they used to call 'vinyl chloride' back at the foundry.









# bubble.




It was any ordinary day. The sun continued it's glorious expansion, the trees basked in the overflowing radiation and children across the middle east strapped themselves to vests of high-impact explosives in faithful martyr of their magical prophet, while the U.S. remained ever-more ignorant of the internal politics of foreign occupation. "Fight a war, in a war," announces a young marshall kit in immaculate serviceman attire, as he paced the outskirts of a halal-certified brothel south of the Kuwait border. Crippled in fear and brooding anxiety, the NFL draft hopeful of 98' was plagued by the contrived fantasies of rape and lore he wished to impose upon these working-class women, driven by the bloody battle he fought against their now-dead husbands. With a gun in one hand and a thoughtless desire to seek pre-emptive revenge, the young man storms the building and pins down a screaming young woman, plunging his penis through her hijab and inside her petit figure. Blasting her brains out at the point of orgasm to complete the scene.

"That was quite overt," I thought to myself, as I took a moment to pause and think about the fundamental implications of my imagination, backdrop against the dyslexic array of dwellings littering the landscape of my train ride into work that particular morning. "...and as we enter our pods, secure in a tunnel-vision of pre-determined repetition, it's important that we remember to gloat at the shit-giggler. He is our only hope." I knew I should have stopped writing year's ago, my mind abuzz with all sorts of fantastical whims and jarring phrases, designed to fright and excite, like a pickled jar of boiled cantaloupe.

Dangled in a mop of disarray, my hair found itself in desperate need of attention. Part of me liked the slight emo gradle, constituent to my overall look as a crazed loner with a knack for competitive fighters and an infatuation for Japanese animated breasts. Oh, another day, another dawn. Rest our souls in the flashy marginalisation of peace, fervour and extreme exuberance. Then in a rush of temporal ammonia, I transferred my mind over to the hands of late-night regret, as I stepped off the train and onto the newly-renovated platform, into a compound of career psychopaths and keyboard warriors. Atop of a vending machine stood a lone gunman, armed with a toothpick and a bucket of cum, ready to drown solace in it's rightful place on the floor of an over-worked McDonalds where he got paid a meager salary and an inoffensive staff discount on all meals after 6pm.

Truth is that today was hardly ordinary.


People glued to their phones.

The stock market had crashed.







There's something fantastic about sodomy. A religious travesty of heightened caution, no different to blowing up a entire school bus full of Indonesian school children, limbs akimbo, burnt sheets of trigonometry fluttering down in a cascade of ceremony, only to condemn those who practice formal expression in a much, much less formal way.

"You really are evil, aren't you?" says Milo, skipping about on the side walk, a-twirl in her own world of disturbing imagination of primary fascination. A curious beast I one-day hoped to tame and unleash, like a feel-good tsunami of sexual domination. Clearly, you didn't need to hear that.

"It's just a joke," I remarked, a light teaser of things to come, hoping to sound lost in my own intellectuality, obviously inundated in an air of desperation I'd simply accepted as the lonely cousin following me around everywhere.

The harbor atmosphere, caulked in the silhouette of a family galore, witnessing a domestic episode of "dad knows best", was suitably romantic, if not a touch endearing. As I looked up at the night sky, it was clear that the clouds were amiss in their treachery, shrouding their eerie ways into the whispering wind and creeping shadows, lurking and melding themselves into our fragmented movement refracting against the crayon river below. Thankfully it was just enough to convince her to hold my hand, something which I'd been thinking about since we first met.

I'd always been afraid of this moment, where man meets women, carried by the heavy hands of fate onto something greater. Where the expectation was loud and vast, ripping itself methodologically into the grain of your skin, scolding bone as a consequence of childish demeanor.

The interior of the large department mall barely knew itself.

The aromatic disparity grabs me and cuts into my wiring, and yet the beauty is undeniable.

"Did you always think we'd date?" she said, almost rhetorically, expecting me to cave in an














There's a particular mistress in every bar.

Clashed against the senses,


In a deafening reverberation of broken noise, the singing cheers and alcoholic folly of the bar left open a new a generation of patrons to falter and despair, clashing slovenly against the senses in an agonising huff of futility. It was clear who had become adjusted to the rein, those blacked out youth in their cordoroy t-shirts and labelled affair, justifying confidence with another stint at the bar. A drunken man swerves around me, smashing his head into the Irish trims lacing their way around the liquor tetrohedron of doom.


"Man, where do they find these women," I retort,



Admittedly, I was never much of an alcohol kind of guy. I always













# interview.



I eat. It's just the hungry of us in society do. We push aside the grazers and the cob-hobblers and we take our chunk with two hands, raw with the blood of our prey. Dead animals, wounded children, wheel-chair bound pregnant octopus, vying for your attention on a conveyor belt of prey.

It's all in the grab. The pull. The way shoulders align when being flung into a jail cells, beaten and stabbed by a man in uniform no one even remotely understands. He reels your head in by the roots of your hair, only to spit in your face with smirk intention. You know, because he loves you in a way no other man can. The eat is a source of premonition which responsibility calls home and which I like to . It is the circle which you do not draw, which




# house.




All aboard the fringe. An effervescent display of gaudy rigour wrapped-fancy in a quarter-mile sweat-band of pound and flesh. Don't we all just love a set of fresh dazzling eyes, daudy fuckin' crand, carrying themselves helplessly towards the emotionless gaze of triumph tying us all together into this absolute pit of love and despair. My fingers dig-deep into the scar tissue oozing from my imagination, manic to the pixie queen shaking violently to an empty bottle of cultivar gin.

Recently I decided to buy a house, something which I would consider an achievement. Surely, anything which defines necessity should be considered an achievement, or has the necessity trumped me as part of some underground ritual of autonomous self-hate and misdemeanour. It has windows with a tight sheen for upper-class movement, and it's doors come fixed with an embrace for communal living. The backyard by any means, is a timid beast. It's what the vicar ordered and more.

And yet here we are. At a point suspended in time, despondent in it's awe, captured only moments ago on a 10' inch single-frame picture to be endlessly thrown into question, as the words drown you out approaching your 27th birthday. The cream-pie is delicious dear, please do make more.

"You know you look like shit, right," uttered my friend, casked in stack of boxes as he stumbled his way to the van.

"Go face-fuck yourself," I shouted, almost giddy at the uncompromising nature of my remark. It was always the delicate wordplay that astonished me, choking


 slightly choking on the wordplay for how smartly delicate it made me feel.



I live in the kind of area that demotes personality. It is new-found rugged, with a hearty family-core. The kind of place that instigates failure for white-men over the age of 50, as they prune their beards in hope of Anglican saviour. Don't like a kebab? Eat a kebab, you slut. This is the movement you wished for. Now go out and get it, you amiritious hunk of non-classification.

It won't quite eat you alive, but it's an easy thing to portray for those none-the-wiser. Eat the lies up sweetie. They're delicious in glee.


The first thing which hits you is the commute. It takes me roughly 2 hours to get to the city, which is something I've largely become accustomed to. For better or worse, necessity dictates all and with this newfound love you shall smile where those might weep and weep where the darkness continues. Pretty smile, pretty pickle. Don't be shy at this year's annual cluster-fuck drowning! Pray the body-bag fits your eyes, although there's an upgrade coming for next-season's killing.

I must admit, I actually had a bit of an outer-body experience when I looked at where exactly my residence was situated relative to the rest of the metropolis. It occurred to me that it was just as far away as my childhood home was, which at the time was in the complete sticks. Now I'm sure it's worth millions.

Certainly, I don't mind it. The whole this-is-your-new-life-not-so-different-to-the-old-one mentality. It's the kind of experience I wouldn't turn a blind-eye to, and as necessity itself states, a welcoming arduous cloverfield for all to compare. It is progress perched on a pedestal.

On the contrary, there is the life of unknowing privilege and I couldn't think of anything worse. It reminds me of all the rich, white folk on the train who throw a gut-wrenching tantrum about the train being 5 minutes late to their evening-gown souriee. Yes, I'm sure everything was great back in your day when Father Australia came round' n' force-fed Osmocote into the great gully of reserve you call Sunday's self-nourishment. And yes, we do hope to plunder your corpse with a pickaxe and a butter knife.

What I believe at the end of the day is in the power of resilience and so far, this seems to be the life I have planned. Change. Adaptation. Self-improvement. I mean, I no longer have any addictions. I have a career that means well. It's almost as if certainty and me have come to some sort of clandestine agreement never to argue again. Yet is something actually building up under the poorly-applied coat of paint dripping from my face? Is there a tension I've merely bottled up in replace for my seemingly irrational desires? Quite possibly, although ultimately like all human beings, I am simply trying my best.

Sure, there are times at night where I fall into an awful twitch. Usually in response to having so much responsibility around me, that I don't quite know how to cope. Although I suspect it's because of the huge-backlog of homeownership which taunts me in each frame of my existence. Is the avocado tree I planted going to suffer a heart-attack in the middle of the night? When will I have time to paint all these walls? And the who the fuck will build all this Ikea furniture?

All questions which will surely adapt and rearrange themselves in due time, as the pressure continues it's cataclysmic rise into some kind of post-orgasmic monster.

A young immigrant stares into my eyes, searing patiently with an immuninescent intensity set on forgotting his past. It's a psychological duel.
