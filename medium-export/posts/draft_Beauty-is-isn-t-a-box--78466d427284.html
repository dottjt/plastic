I love her more than anything else in the world and I feel blessed to have a person in my life that I can easily relate to and explore intimately with.</p><p name="99cc" id="99cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Admittedly, we have issues. In fact, every relationship has issues, which I have come to appreciate have less to do with each other and more to do with how we feel about ourselves individually.</p><p name="5e7a" id="5e7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She is easily stressed and there are times where she feels insecure, but that’s okay. It’s just what women do.</p><p name="7c2e" id="7c2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the contrary, I get easily attached to visual cues and silly ideas in my mind. I find myself fantasising about other women on public transport or even passing by and it makes me feel insecure about what I have.</p><p name="2b98" id="2b98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We admit that we have problems and we work towards fixing them and that is what is most important in a relationship, learning to change and compromise.</p><p name="4df4" id="4df4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, we have both gotten a lot better and I am incredibly proud of how far my girlfriend has come. My girlfriend is a lot more independent and she’s overcoming her fears in leaps and bounds.</p><p name="a2c0" id="a2c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have also come a long way and part of my compulsiveness was expressed in my addiction. I don’t necessarily agree with the idea of addiction, which is why I much liken the idea of attachment. We can easily get attached to things that are non-addict, just as we can with things that are addictive.</p><p name="ec2d" id="ec2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was highly attached to my depression and I idolised mental illness as something cute, romantic. I was also chronically attached to pornography and the women on Chaturbate. I even found myself messaging one of them in one of my depressive episodes, which greatly upset my girlfriend.</p><p name="d247" id="d247" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose it has been a process of trial and error; learning to love myself and others unconditionally, rather than because they need to meet certain requirements and this is where I have struggled a lot.</p><p name="2e8f" id="2e8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My girlfriend, though beautiful, is quite overweight. While I light-heartedly joke about it, and it genuinely does not bother me at times, when I’m feeling particularly vulnerable it does get in the way.</p><p name="842a" id="842a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are times when I only see her weight and not the person who she is and it’s a horrible feeling, because I know it’s not right, yet it’s how I’ve configured my brain.</p><p name="457c" id="457c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve found however, that these are ideas grow slowly overtime. At first I get concerned about her weight, from a health point of view. Then after a while, I begin judging her for her weight.</p><p name="d653" id="d653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I judge her for not being physically active. Then my mind begins making assumptions about her weight and what she does. Maybe she never exercises like she says she does? When was the last time I ever saw her exercise?</p><p name="1c2f" id="1c2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then you start taking her personally.</p><p name="0b09" id="0b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose being in this situation has taught me patience. To be patient with people and not to</p><p name="814e" id="814e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">, like a cancer. First you start judging her for her weight in your mind. You take her actions personally</p><p name="0442" id="0442" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whenever I see a woman with a massive pair of breasts, I just crumble.</p><p name="f010" id="f010" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I acknowledge</p><p name="295b" id="295b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’s not overly opinionated.</p><p name="430c" id="430c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hard being a guy.</p><p name="cc49" id="cc49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Men, like women, are easily manipulated into believing stupid things.</p><p name="fd37" id="fd37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think women need to be more empathetic of men.</p><p name="e371" id="e371" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We totally get it. We’re not a perfect bunch,</p><p name="755c" id="755c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="0c73" id="0c73" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
