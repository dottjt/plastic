I’m slowly regaining control over myself and I feel confident in my ability to *shine*.</p><p name="e4bd" id="e4bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most important thing in this particular scenario is that I’m in a good position, away from all the trauma and away from all the negative thoughts in my mind. I no longer feel stuck inside my rabbit hole and a lot of my recent confusion has been cleared, particularly in regards to my girlfriend and living out of home.</p><p name="6cc2" id="6cc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, it’s up to me to maintain this clarity, which is also what has contributed towards my slight worry. I am constantly reminded of what I may become in the future and though it frightens me, it calms me more than anything. It calms me to know that I’m aware of my circumstances and who I am, and that I have the ability to avoid becoming that person. It’s humbling and that’s a good thing. I really need to focus on being modest and learn to maintain these kinds of neutral attitudes, where I don’t get too far ahead of myself, in my prolonged, somewhat dreadful smile.</p><p name="e750" id="e750" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have taken control of my diet, of my health, of my relationship, of my life, and of my mind. I am learning to become aware of myself and avoid the anxiety and depression which I seemingly create from the pivoting madness rotting in my brain. I’m breathing. Sometimes choking, but mostly breathing; the stale air conjuring flies around my buzzing heap of neurological mass, pretending to be something greater than the layers of fat and protein floating within.</p><p name="1bf0" id="1bf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have my studies and my hobbies. I love learning and in particular, I love drawing. Though seemingly pointless, I know it will help tremendously with my ambitions to become a front-end developer. I suppose you cannot design if you cannot draw, and though it’s figure-drawing I’m studying, I know it’ll become useful at some point in my life.</p><p name="e490" id="e490" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My main issue at the moment is with my energy levels. I still feel perpetually tired throughout the day, which obviously affects my mood. It might be due to my cutting out of caffeine, alcohol, wheat and largely, sugar, though I’ve also come to realise it’s because I haven’t been eating breakfast and lunch, which obviously is something I must start doing. It’s just hard waking up so early. You know?</p><p name="10eb" id="10eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to learn to love myself. I want to be happy and not the kind of happy based in achievement, but the kind of happy where I’m in control of my life. That really, has been the only thing that has made me happy and it’s only once I lose it, that I realise how precious it was all along.</p><p name="38f9" id="38f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hard part, in my opinion, is walking that fine line between ambition and insanity. Sometimes I just overload myself with information and I fail to cope. Other times I’ll be so tired that my struggling to do anything will contribute towards my negative state of mind. Maintaining perspectives is a bitch, but it’s also rather charming and something akin to living a healthy, normal life.</p><p name="9158" id="9158" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be normal. That really, is all I want to be.</p><p name="1e64" id="1e64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was thinking about this at work today, how I’d be so much better off if I didn’t pursue all those risky, dangerous, harmful behaviours which drove me further into my illness. It also made me realise that the less stupid shit I do, the less trauma I will have and the happier I will be in the long term.</p><p name="036b" id="036b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I still feel somewhat… I guess, reminded by the debilitation of my mental state. While I don’t have high expectations for myself, that isn’t to say that I’m not grateful, quiet and appreciative of what I have. There’s still a level of vulnerability in me, which I know I’m better than, but am keeping in the closet just to be exposed to some of the occasional shame, which has endowed me almost saintly.</p><p name="f0cf" id="f0cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, I also acknowledge that I am a powerful individual with dreams and ambitions. Working towards those dreams is something which I hope to cherish, for as long as I can maintain. Though seriously, studying computational complexity is pretty cool and even though it’s doing my head in, I know it’s something that is challenging my mental capacity, without trying to hit on other women, or ruin someone else’s life.</p><p name="4e1a" id="4e1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I quite like it.</p></div></div></section>
