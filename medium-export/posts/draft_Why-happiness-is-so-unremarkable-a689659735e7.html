Our mental health clearly cannot be worth anything. Our happiness is just a ruse. </p><p name="ca94" id="ca94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately there is nothing special about our feelings or emotions. They do not have some kind of mystical power over us. They are not foreign, unobtainable or dangerous to our health.</p><p name="bfdb" id="bfdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are simply mentally ill, due precisely because you do not understand basic concepts such as these.

They just take a little getting used to, that’s all. </p></div></div></section>
