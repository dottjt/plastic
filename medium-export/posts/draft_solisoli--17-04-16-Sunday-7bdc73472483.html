I think that’s a very beautiful thing. </p><p name="fd85" id="fd85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This weekend has been quite good. From Friday, I’ve been spending most days simply sitting at my desk practicing my drawing. I really am coming to enjoy it, as I learn how to draw form and all those wonderful things. I know it’s going to take time, however a large part of it is pushing forward and really aim to learn how to do great things using shapes. For me, it’s as much an intellectual endeavour as it is a creative one. That really is the beauty of art. </p><p name="dcf5" id="dcf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I just feel so composed within myself. I don’t feel fearful or anxious or insecure. I feel focused and I feel as if I have purpose in my life. Not the kind of purpose that equates to obligation, however the kind of purpose that makes me feel comfortable with myself. I feel comfortable with everything I’m doing, even the really difficult and challenging things, which makes life feel as if it’s a breeze. Yes, life feels like a breeze and I think that’s a really wonderful thing to have. </p><p name="d26c" id="d26c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happy and in control. Meditation and creating perspective in my life, by stopping, slowing down and adopting an air of peace. It means I’ve been experiencing less conflict in my life, as I break down the arguments and conflict holding me down. </p><p name="da27" id="da27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, it feels as if there’s a kind of monster in the corner. If I think about my mother or mimi or certain aspects of my past, it feels like it’s a regretable disaster. My strategy has been to prevent myself from thinking about the past, which I’m not sure is healthy or not. I suppose it could be. </p><p name="96e0" id="96e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is there any point thinking about the past? Is there any reason to think back to those moments? Is it perhaps that I’m trying to reclaim myself? </p><p name="2b0d" id="2b0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No. I believe I will live in the present moment, live happily and live within my own mind. I will live as a conscious entity. I will live with vigour, with love and with </p><p name="b86f" id="b86f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Forget it. My mind has turned to mush. It’s like, just an unconscious shut down. These words don’t mean anything. </p><p name="3661" id="3661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">That’s okay. I really do love my art. </p></div></div></section>
