To begin with, I’ve always glorified abnormality as something special and unique, almost canonical-like, and secondly, I’ve always maintained a distorted understanding of what normal is.</p><p name="4ae1" id="4ae1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Normal has generally always meant something bad. Not just bad, but plain wrong. I’ve always viewed normality as something harmful, dysfunctional and deceiving. Of course, I wasn’t entirely wrong: the world is not always a pretty place. I suppose I didn’t have the experience, wisdom or insight to truly have a balanced, appreciative view of life; no different to most people growing up in a toxic environment.</p><p name="2e1c" id="2e1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Things started to change after high school. I suppose I began to develop my ambitious ideas further in an attempt to discover myself. I decided to pursue my cynicism in the only way I knew how: by pursuing extremes in the hope that I would break some kind of barrier, proving myself right, though never undecidedly, never wrong.</p><p name="de3c" id="de3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was stupid, obviously, especially when you’re taking acid in the middle of the night, but when your mind is so damaged, so intent on proving itself to the world, you’re probably going to end up breaking some shit.</p><p name="d8e5" id="d8e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of calming down, I went full retard. Rather than dismantle my problems, in an attempt to solve them in some kind of intricate, clearly self-defeating way, I would soldier ahead, with no particularly understanding why. It was just me, and my crazy mind, following an agenda I can barely understand.</p><p name="9bee" id="9bee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s how it’d work: I’d pursue an extreme, resulting in trauma, further reinforcing my beliefs of “I failed because I wasn’t extreme enough”, resulting in further extremes and larger traumas.</p><p name="6722" id="6722" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe that’s why I have such a fixation with my first relationship. It represented a turning point in my life, not only as the largest extreme, but as the largest trauma as well. The guilt and comparative suffering from that episode always supersedes anything else I’ve done. I don’t feel comfortable writing about it, however it’s something I eventually want to accept, though forgetting has afforded me peace for now.</p><p name="6d19" id="6d19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having said all that, I now take a very different point of view as to what normal is nowadays. I realise that normal has nothing to do with my perception of others. I realise that everyone was abnormal all along, including myself. I understand that normal is living my life in a sustainable way which allows me to continue being normal. I understand that normal is about promoting my mental and physical health as a human being. I understand that being normal is something enjoyable, and in fact, a proper qualification for happiness.</p><p name="78b4" id="78b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first place to start, of course, is with my actions and behaviours. I am making the effort to no longer pursue abnormal behaviours which may result in further trauma. I try and avoid people and relations who contribute towards my trauma. I look after my health by eating healthily and trying to maintain some sort of work-life balance within my life. I know my strategy needs to evolve into dismantling my fears, however it’s an effective starting point for me to become comfortable with myself.</p><p name="135c" id="135c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also need to change my perception of what normal is. Normal is not average. Normal is about taking advantage of the capabilities you have as a human being, to strive and become whoever you want to be. It is about freedom, liberation; at least as allowed within the context of my own life. It is about fulfilling the responsibility to maintain what’s yours, particularly regarding your own state of mind.</p><p name="85ea" id="85ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main challenge is in repressing and realigning my desire to be abnormal. The hard part is in dealing with the nostalgia and occasional urge to do something stupid. Maintaining awareness of myself has truly helped. Self-awareness is like a constant state of surveillance, where you remind yourself to keep your cool and tell yourself that what you’re not doing is okay. Learning to slow down, breathe and relax. When I’m at the bus stop and I have time to kill, I will just close my eyes and meditate. I have come to realise that energy retention is a huge thing, something I will be studying more closely.</p><p name="b7e3" id="b7e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I really like the idea that every small thing you do helps and I believe in the long run, it is something which will make more sense. When you think about it, you make thousands of small agreements each day, which when they add up, contribute towards your mental state. But even if you change 10% of those agreements, it will still have an effect on what you think and feel.</p><p name="c666" id="c666" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I acknowledge that the damage has been done, and that placing my past behind me is important. A large part of that is embracing who I am today and starting my life afresh. I believe that’s why drawing is such an important part of my recovery. Not only is it a new skill I’m developing in regards to my new self, however I can place my drawings around the house and see what I’ve achieved with my talent.</p><p name="c4cf" id="c4cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m incredibly grateful for what I have. I complain, compare, judge, destroy and repeat; however I’m grateful to have the opportunity to change all that.</p><p name="0071" id="0071" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
