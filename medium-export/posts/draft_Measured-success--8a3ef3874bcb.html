It’s been approximately one month and a half since I last ‘relapsed’ and feel entirely in-control of myself. </p><p name="81d5" id="81d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think the main thing is that I’ve been taking it easy, and I haven’t been burning out, and subsequently falling into the hands of mania. Which is difficult within itself, because it simply means dealing with depression in other ways, such as literally just being depressed and maintaining the awareness that I simply need to push through.</p><p name="8e20" id="8e20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, it’s also been quite an enlightening experience, because it’s forcing me to look at things from a different perspective. Rather than relying on certain, self-destructive means to deal with my depression, instead it’s having me question and reconsider the role of depression itself. </p><p name="6f78" id="6f78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because it’s like, when you can’t escape from your senses, you’re forced to instead understand their role in your life. And from this, I’ve discovered a number of valuable perspectives. </p><p name="5b73" id="5b73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, I was feeling depressed over nothing in particular. Well, it was actually about some of the events that had happened in the past, but nothing that’s necessarily worth getting depressed about in the present moment. And it occurred to me that being sad about these things is actually a form of self-harm within itself.</p><p name="cac1" id="cac1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, the reason why it’s important to explore your depression without trying to escape from it, is because although it’s immensely uncomfortable, it also exposes the true nature of depression as this kind of never-ending emotion of misery. And it’s only once you’re stuck in this predicament, can you actually become aware enough to question why you’re actually depressed in the first place. </p><p name="0473" id="0473" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was at this moment that I realise that depression itself wasn’t helping me. </p><p name="c300" id="c300" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
