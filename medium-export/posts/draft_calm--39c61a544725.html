I’ve been so caught up in my own guilt, struggle and lies, that my mind has been crunching, folding; made incomprehensible by my decisions flailing in spite, towards some unknown object cursing within the distance. </p><p name="0735" id="0735" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This weekend has been a bit of a battle. Well, actually, a huge battle, predicated by tears, breakdowns and domestic arguing, however it’s all over. It’s all over and it’s over for good. The cycle is complete. I can finally breathe and feel self-assured that tomorrow will be fine. I can finally be happy, without worry, or fear. </p><p name="934d" id="934d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So many different thoughts. So many different realisations and self-realisations. Days preoccupied with depression. Days spent wasting away, paralysed with uncertainty. All gone. Thankfully. </p><p name="5ce4" id="5ce4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m grateful to finally have control over everything I want to have control over. I have all my vices under control, I think. No more caffeine, no more alcohol, no more pornography, no more gluten. It’s been hard, but it’s been necessary and I’m so glad to be on the other end </p><p name="2e47" id="2e47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I finally had ‘the talk’ with my girlfriend and we clarified so many different things, about who we are and who we need to become. Of those, I need to learn not to focus on the bad things, and express positive reinforcement for the good things she does, no matter how small. I need to constantly communicate with her. I need to not let my insecurity get in the way of expressing myself, without assumption or taking things personally. </p><p name="71e9" id="71e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s been so hard with her, for both of us, because it feels like my emotions had setup a great big wall which wouldn’t allow any of my emotions to feel her. When it gets to the point that your “love yous” become customary, rather than heart-felt, you feel as terrified as you do helpless. You don’t really know what to say or what to do. You just think your head is silly and hide your issues underneath the bed, only to be confronted by the same exact fears, prodding you at the gut. </p><p name="83c2" id="83c2" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="4301" id="4301" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best thing? I still have tomorrow off and I can finally relax and study and do all those things I enjoy. I also drew a picture of Dave Franco having sex with Zac Efron today. I think it’s beautiful.</p><p name="b6b1" id="b6b1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="52b5" id="52b5" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
