In fact, I have been consistently productive and focused on my goals and who I want to be. </p><p name="8984" id="8984" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve decided to leave my PR &amp; Communications position after nearly one year and it’s been emotionally… well, it’s somewhat of a paradigm shift for me. I don’t feel worried or afraid of the future. I think there are beautiful things to come, however there’s also a lot of adjusting that needs to take place if it is going to be a smooth transition.</p><p name="4ef3" id="4ef3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Earlier I was contemplating my vices and while I did partially act out on them, I didn’t do anything significant. The biggest adjustment is with how I perceive and work with my available time. I no longer have a rigid schedule that binds me to my purpose, which means I need to be much more careful with how I plan and spend my time. </p><p name="b0b9" id="b0b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today is a bit special in that it’s a public holiday, so it’s like a trial, I guess. At least I now understand my expectations, which can only be a good thing. </p><p name="3e7a" id="3e7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, the frustration of programming is something which is affecting me, but thankfully it’s only temporary and something which I can work with. </p><p name="9efe" id="9efe" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
