And a large part of it has to do with my mental health.</p><p name="578b" id="578b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I only ever feel inspired to write when my feelings are out-of-whack, and while it’s obvious these feelings allow me produce a very wonderful expression of word and mind-play. It’s also a form of expression I’m looking to leave behind.</p><p name="7fac" id="7fac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Precisely, I made the decision approximately one month ago to take my mental health seriously. As in, “I never want to feel triggered or perpetually sad ever again, because there’s just so much more I want to do with my life” kind of serious.</p><p name="a48c" id="a48c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The kind of serious where I’m 100% committed and have absolutely zero doubt in my mind that this is what I want. Where I’ve fully realised that there is absolutely nothing more important than my mental health. Even if it means completely changing every single aspect of my being.</p><p name="d058" id="d058" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Essentially, what I’ve decided to do is adopt a systematic approach towards my mental health, taking things from the past which have worked, applying them on a daily basis. I’m practising meditation, CBT, as well as a wealth of perspective exercises — everything to keep me regular.</p><p name="7565" id="7565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I must say, it’s been working an absolute treat.</p><p name="e617" id="e617" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I no longer feel this kind of emotional uncertainty within me. I feel genuinely happy, and most importantly, I’m in-control of my emotions and more importantly, my thoughts. Everything almost feels unconditional. I’m learning to forgive and refrain from making judgements about others, and I’m learning about how we create beliefs, as well as how to dissolve them.</p><p name="30bd" id="30bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, I’m not perfect at it (and I imagine it’s an ongoing life process that will never end) but I recognise that I’m making progress each and every day. And the way I see it, is that every second I spend being happy is one second that is going to have profound long-term effects on how I feel about myself in the future.</p><p name="1a55" id="1a55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So as far as I understand, these posts on Medium merely serve as an expression of my mental illness. And that’s something I’m no longer interested in expressing.</p><p name="4a4a" id="4a4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another reason why I’m no longer interested in writing these posts is because I’ve decided to take up art instead! I don’t know why, however it’s something that’s really hooked my attention, and it’s something I’ve been pursing with great enthusiasm over the past few months.</p><p name="363d" id="363d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Largely, because I find it immensely challenging and it’s an activity that takes me far away from my comfort zone — unlike writing which has become second nature to me.</p><p name="62a4" id="62a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s interesting to think about my writing, because I first started my creative pursuit exactly a decade ago when I created my very first blog: adelaidesucks.blogspot.com.</p><p name="9f14" id="9f14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it’s like, on this anniversary, I’m deciding to choose a different direction in life and perhaps even in ten years time, I’ll become a master artist and will choose yet another direction to fill my time here on earth.</p><p name="88b2" id="88b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In passing, I’m writing this post to signify a formal leaving of who I was behind.</p><p name="08e1" id="08e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understandably, it’s only been one month, however through consistency and method, I have proven to myself that this is something I can do.</p><p name="3a6a" id="3a6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to be happy, and I want to learn to love.</p><p name="5c9b" id="5c9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Hopefully the world can understand.</p></div></div></section>
