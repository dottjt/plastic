It was never “You did a wonderful job. You should be proud.” It was always “You did a wonderful job, however you could, sorry, should have done this better.”</p><p name="cf74" id="cf74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, when you’re young and impressionable, you don’t know what is good or bad, right or wrong. You don’t know what you’re capable of, nor have a gauge for how life should be.</p><p name="de62" id="de62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You just go with the flow and if you ever feel shit about yourself or unhappy, then that’s probably just because you’re an inherently shit person.</p><p name="932e" id="932e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For those who study psychology, especially as I later found out having dealt with my own personal mental health issues, this kind of bad reasoning develops itself into cynical mindsets.</p><p name="0ef3" id="0ef3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you are subjected with pessimistic mindsets , you become one of those terrible</p><p name="c07a" id="c07a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, I was a very pessimistic child.</p><p name="1489" id="1489" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hated everyone. I thought everyone else was stupid. More importantly, I</p><p name="3765" id="3765" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I developed zero ability to empathise with others and yet there I was, the biggest fucking asshole you would have ever met.</p><p name="2a9f" id="2a9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel different now. I feel like I’m a lot better person and that I’m not entirely harmful, yet</p><p name="9321" id="9321" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It wasn’t that my mother didn’t care. She cared and loved me beyond belief and still does to this day. She’s the kind of person that has the best of intentions.</p><p name="49e7" id="49e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s just that she’s a dumb, retarded bitch.</p><p name="13bc" id="13bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have nothing against her. I feel incredibly grateful to have the privilege of any kind of family; a family which provides support (perhaps not emotional support).</p><p name="f71d" id="f71d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mother just isn’t very smart and I don’t believe I can blame her for it.</p><p name="21e4" id="21e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe most mothers aren’t smart. On the one hand, we can be smart individuals, but terrible mothers. I believe my mother is one of those people.</p><p name="e586" id="e586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it’s no different to men who are terrible at trading stocks or being fathers. Just in the heat of the moment, your emotions get the better of you and you just crumble like an idiot.</p><p name="4ce6" id="4ce6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It must have been difficult being a single mother. I think over the years she’s developed a strong distaste for men, or rather, for individuals that are not her.</p><p name="2df9" id="2df9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the issue is that I’ve become my mother and I’ve lost most my friends due to her way of thinking. I have a habit of criticising others, rather than giving them praise where it is due.</p><p name="ec25" id="ec25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each morning, I listen to the same album by the same band. Circa Survive’s second EP Appendage.</p><p name="e8f9" id="e8f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a line that reminds me to remain humble and to remember that I’m no better than anyone else and I think it’s important for us to remember.</p><p name="71f5" id="71f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is no reason to feel bad, helpless or hate others and no, my mother isn’t stupid.</p><p name="355f" id="355f" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We all go through the same thing, at different times.”</p><p name="4d69" id="4d69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to be a positive role model. I want to rise above and show others that what may seem impossible, can be done. That is how I choose to live my life, as someone capable and alive.</p><p name="bfec" id="bfec" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
