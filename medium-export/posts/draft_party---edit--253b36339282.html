(edit) </h3><p name="5ddd" id="5ddd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">It was at a party. </p><p name="90c6" id="90c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I usually do well at parties. The thumping music. The banal excitement. The scantily clad women, drenched in portrait attire, loosely suggesting a quaint ease in the hormones pumping through your body. I guess I’m just another hopeless sucker in a circuit of grey sexual inertia, choking down on the emotions racing me towards a swift, but sudden death. </p><p name="0355" id="0355" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Huddled like a collection of dead corpses along a Cambodian highway, I’ll pretend to listen to your jokes and stories as my mind gazes for a girl I can appropriately swindle. Maybe a kiss. Possibly a snog, in a kind backhanded sort of way. Though really, you do it for the chase; that primal instinct uttering fantasy as sold by Hollywood and the chance to become a bride, in a heartwarming series of sloven insecurity. </p><p name="11e5" id="11e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s important to be silly, because silly people always have fun. They forget about the protected sex or the gluten-infused challenges of trying to eat pizza as a dyslexic nutritionist. Dampened expectation conceding with a drunken human mind. Don’t worry about the ol’ way of life you have tucked deep inside that pocket of yours. It’s worthness. It’s ugly.</p><p name="c489" id="c489" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chuffing down on the auburn illegality of a dry cigarette, I remember handing her a dirty gaze of ill-prepared bewilderment. It wasn’t subtle, it wasn’t cute, and I don’t think she was the girl I wanted. She was overweight; a victim of her own insecurity, masked by the innocence she wanted the world to see. </p><p name="bc93" id="bc93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main issue was that she was smart enough not to drink or smoke and it was getting on my nerves. Parties aren’t for being smart. They’re able pretending to be so daringly stupid, whilst maintaing the ruse. Of course, those who party too hard eventually do become dumb, which is why you only ever keep your involvement to 21st birthdays, as this was the case.</p><p name="a608" id="a608" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She was hiding from herself and it wasn’t attractive. Besides, she wasn’t looking for the kind of sleaze I was hoping to get away with. I was seeking a different kind of lie; a self-perpetuated entry into the question-less disgust I knew would satisfy my cheap indifference. I flicked the smokey reminder into the fire pit, walking off with a thick grime of disastisfication on my face. </p><p name="72e5" id="72e5" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="8c45" id="8c45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, there was this other girl with a beauty that almost stung. She was gorgeous, though dumb. Really dumb. The kind of dumb that springs a step in your heart and restarts the cognition of ambitions that comes. </p><p name="5aff" id="5aff" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="02a9" id="02a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, I should have felt terrible at these thoughts.</p><p name="4e04" id="4e04" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="9c2b" id="9c2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was only one issue. I had competition. </p><p name="f1ce" id="f1ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They’d gone off into a room together and there was no chance. </p><p name="310b" id="310b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
