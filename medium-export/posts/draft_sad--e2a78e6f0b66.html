Fight child. Oh, you silly child: I never said you could die. “Grab at hell and run.”</p><p name="0848" id="0848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though before you’re able to comprehend life’s bitter jaw — firmly clamped on the collapsed exterior of your inner-trepidation — you find yourself dragged away into a dumpster, knife in back n’ all. Crapped on and discarded like the circles making dry ice inside your forgotten decanter, you find yourself lulled into a false sense of security; a slow dismantling of your soul in a dark, solemn room, propagating cheap culture to an audience of daft causes. How sad. </p><p name="53ea" id="53ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">God speaks in resolute, dreary tones, collecting solace from the vital bits of information he could never extract from your pride. Of course, not quite the local supermarket as in “that kind of friendliness” however clearly incompatible with your sensibilities, none-the-less.  </p><p name="f560" id="f560" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Kicking and screaming, your mind ceases working. Did the world turn black? Did it, you fool? You sit there, by yourself, in tears, tears, tears; trying to piece together what was supposed to be a simple commute, now plagued with rape and plunder; an odd stranger who’s decided, quite whimsically, to come visit for an afternoon or two, perhaps to prop and tantalise at the illness brewing deep from within.</p><p name="00fe" id="00fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now that’s a narrative, subtle chomp. </p><p name="c39d" id="c39d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So that was Friday. It wasn’t the worst Friday I’d ever experienced, but it wasn’t the kind of Friday that taps on your shoulder and surprises you with a pretty cake, and even though it was planned to be an amazing Friday, a Friday full of hope and potential, it wasn’t until I received confirmation from the very people I’d been trying to avoid at all costs, that my innocence had crumbled, suicided, deformed, into a bad chapter full of mythology and violence: the world’s two greatest vices, fucking and spiralling into a bunch of tricky thoughts and malpractices, tearing me into squander; relentlessly consuming my ability to feel.</p><p name="a48e" id="a48e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All of a sudden, as if conspired in dishonest atrophy, I become the ugly, nasty, demon child. Yes, it’s clear that I’m a demon child. A horrible, insecure fucking demon, who has unfortunately inhabited this largely human form, to falsely convince myself that I’m worth something. Of course, part of you that suspects these rumours are false, however maybe that’s just the demon talking from within. Squeeze my lemons. Maybe that demon is a liar, who is pretending  to be human, so that I can happily live without guilt. I’m sure that’s my uncanny reason, if not littered with grime.  </p><p name="f606" id="f606" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here I am, sitting on this bench, constructed from hollowed steel, and my body is lamenting, almost devine, to some kind of petty arrangement I never thought would come clean. Part of my disbelief, I imagine, is wavering. I’m not quite sure why, but what the hell am I to know? Waver you demon. Waver till the human goes gold. </p><p name="9b31" id="9b31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think, it really comes down to those moments where you inadvertently feel like holding yourself, and yet when you can barely feel where your hands start, to where your misery ends, you can only hope to swear and thunder at the misdirection stabbing you at the spleen. </p><p name="bda8" id="bda8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know it’s futile. I know I have no hope left in me and when my eyes gather obsessively at the dust, clouding my vision in pretentious agony, I stare back at my shadow, stroking its dark outline; pretending to exist, pretending to fly in the face of all those tricks and lies my vocabulary has propagated into wholesome nutrition.</p><p name="9cac" id="9cac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Come Saturday and I’m a lonely wreck. I know I have potential, as I’d managed to demonstrate throughout the week, however it’s a potential long forgotten. Who am I? Who really knows, nor cares. Self-awareness. Meditation. Quite honestly, what difference does it make when all you can feel is the sadness, flowing like cask wine into the greed of your dilapidated future.</p><p name="88c5" id="88c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, Sunday. Sunday wasn’t too bad, actually. I was quite happy Sunday. I remember gazing into my girlfriend’s eyes, bewildered at her beauty, caught in the spell of our love, good as a good thing can be. Yes, very good. I was happy. Sunday made me realise that I have the ability to be happy and that it’s something I can initiate at will, if I so please. I remember, our bodies, entwined into a lovely silhouette, bemoaned in pleasure and harmonious symphony. I’m not quite sure how one would describe magic, however it is feeling of fire, passion and love. </p><p name="c527" id="c527" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is depression. My humble depression. That is what my mind is telling me and I know it is right. </p><p name="b356" id="b356" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today is Monday, which means it’s a weekday, which means I’m going to be studying through my teeth for reasons I no longer remember. Of course, like any of these days, today is also a sad day, which means I probably won’t be studying, as I’m left wondering why I’m here, on this sullen earth, why I care, why I live, why I stare; even though it all made sense, not some few days ago.</p><p name="4499" id="4499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mind is buzzing: a cerebral reaction to my inner desperation; a sort of screaming nanny, yearning at me to be modern and proud. Sing to the merry of your men; break their souls and dream. It’s all you have in that tool box of yours; use it with vigour. Construct the pleasure of your dreams. </p><p name="ef78" id="ef78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not happy today, as is evident in these words. I’m sad, lonely and deprived. I’m elementally sad and I know this because I can feel the shiver of silence, sliver through my body and sing like a chorus. Often, I wonder if my depression is unique; unique in the opportunity to give me feeling, as the only living opportunity inside me, appreciating my inability and holding me tight. To me, depression is feeling with purpose, though dainty and scrum, still, purpose none-the-less. Purpose, heavily layered in an unrecognisable series of bad manners and weakly disguised euphemisms.</p><p name="d7aa" id="d7aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t feel worried. I don’t feel anxious. I feel free from myself, as a shadow lying dormant in the harsh, dystopian wind. It hurts as much as it pleasures. Metaphor, be my friend.</p><p name="1a89" id="1a89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To top things off, I’m constantly in pain. I’ve adjusted my posture for the long-term survival of my health, which has created the effect of pushing my bones around in a jarring and confused state; piercing through my tendons and nerves as if Jack the Ripper were hastily slicing away at my 23 year slump. My gums are also experiencing incredible pain, due to my rogue wisdom tooth making living from my dire expense.</p><p name="2698" id="2698" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My pain is also encouraged by the intense workout I did last night, which pushed me to the point of bodily failure. I’m exhausted today, largely because I was unable to sleep last night, which is because I’ve realised that I’ve stopped breathing through my nose, which has prompted me to start breathing through my nose, which has proven impossible, though necessary, resulting in no sleep at all. I also stopped using my fan last night, as that is probably a trend which is not all too good for the body, as I delegate the regulation of my natural body temperature to a machine. </p><p name="11a9" id="11a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A fucking machine. </p><p name="63cf" id="63cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So things haven’t been the smoothest, but you know what? That’s progress and it’s progress for the better. Progress that cannot be avoided and certainly will become  a significant source of flurry within the future, if not addressed now. </p><p name="505e" id="505e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I may say so, I think that my depression is due to my lack of sleep. I worked out and got no sleep. Recipe, my friends, for disaster.</p><p name="7a2e" id="7a2e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
