Yes, I think I’m traumatised. </p><p name="abab" id="abab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know if you’ve ever had an interviewer walk out on you in the middle of an interview, however it’s like having your eyes gouged out.</p><p name="f0a0" id="f0a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think there reaches a point in every job hunter’s search where the pain becomes so contrived to the point of being comical. Not only do you have no clue what to believe, however it just becomes this massive fuck around where no one really knows what the fuck is going on and it’s fucking terrifying.</p><p name="6d24" id="6d24" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="dd0e" id="dd0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Allow me to describe an interview that took place in regards to a PR position for this company.</p><p name="0083" id="0083" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first interviewer was incredibly friendly and welcoming. He clearly explained the job position to me, the expectations, and I provided him with the details of what I could provide to the role. He was invariably happy, which prompted him to invite me to a second interview some moments later.</p><p name="8797" id="8797" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second interview involved a different person and was like having my eyes gouged out. She first asked how I could provide value to their company, and so I said that I’m a really good communicator and I understand brand awareness, to which she stares blankly at me.</p><p name="2389" id="2389" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s like she wanted me to read her mind. She kept asking how I could provide value and I’m like, trying to ask her what she needed help with and what “problems” she needed solving. </p><p name="cb82" id="cb82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I asked her what her current relationship was with Government stakeholders to which she blankly refused to tell me, because apparently that would just be cheating. </p><p name="14a0" id="14a0" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="12d3" id="12d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are times when you don’t want to think about anything and the ensuing moments following a bad interview is one of them. </p><p name="f796" id="f796" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not quite sure what happened.</p><p name="c02b" id="c02b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I walked into the room, holding my strap-lock bag with a chirpy smile and 40 minutes later, proceeded to walk out of the room in a complete daze of misunderstanding. It was like the carpet had been pulled from under my feet, exposing me to the dirt and grime that truly lay beneath the cute exterior. </p><p name="f753" id="f753" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sometimes wonder what kind of an effect I am aiming for; what kind of sick and depraved unfortunality I believe I deserve. </p><p name="c4ab" id="c4ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">walked out. Luscious green. The walls were a type of couch fabric. Opposite me were two individuals, almost with identical integrity. I mean, what actually happened? It’s like I sat down and disappeared for 40 minutes, only to be reminded of my incapability.</p><p name="c563" id="c563" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They tell you not to overthink things, yet when your long-term survival depends upon </p><p name="6546" id="6546" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even when you think you have the thing you want, it’s actually just a ruse; none of it is real and none of it really cares. It merely exists to do those things which you cannot quite understand. Nothing at all, all, all, all, all.</p><p name="4661" id="4661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s all very convincing. It’s a very convincing ruse that you have going on. It whispers and doesn’t really want you to be happy, but claims to be some kind of happy thing which you want. Yes, that YOU wanted. </p><p name="7286" id="7286" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="85ba" id="85ba" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
