I think it comes down to the change in mentality that occurs as you get older, and certainly my writing is the  biggest culprit in relation to this bastardisation. No longer is writing viewed as this innocent, mysterious, almost childish exploration of the mind. Instead, it becomes this tool for economical instigation, to create utility for the world and in a sense, is what I find so disgusting about Medium. </p><p name="a335" id="a335" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It follows a very predictable, sinister pattern of the same click-bait titles, predicated by content that seems relevant within the context of your own life, only to realise that it’s the exact same drull you’ve been listening to for months, and with that, your souls sinks a little further into the impenetrable sand, desensitised to the bullshit you’ve surrounded yourself around. It’s a very dangerous, shrinking pie, that is only a fraction as real as it is fabricated. Welcome to the media landscape of 2016.</p><p name="ffde" id="ffde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I like about these kinds of diary posts is that they’re relevant. Sure, they may not be relevant to you, however they’re highly relevant to me. They are a publication for my own ideas, in my own individualised format, in a way that speaks to me and who I want to become. Sure, I don’t have expert knowledge in a wide variety of areas, however as every writer knows, expertise has become nothing more than a Google search these days, so don’t try and convince me that what you’re selling, is anything more than a rich marketing ploy to convince me otherwise. </p><p name="0c2a" id="0c2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Still, it’s difficult to fight the trend. Not that I’m actually fighting against anyone, however my adult brain, exposed to the relative success of others, has nowhere to go but down. Partly, because this reaction towards commercialised writing is borne out of survival, rather than true expression. Of course, the extra conflicted ones try to mould it into a benign lifestyle, as if self-expression and marketing can become some kind of perennial lifeforce, when in the end, you merely </p><p name="ef38" id="ef38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another thing I’ve been worrying about recently has been my little YouTube experiment. I still upload videos, every one to two weeks, and I call it an experiment, because it’s a bit of a mess at the moment. </p><p name="da89" id="da89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The entire aim of my recent revival into video creation, was to witness the human orifice, breaking down upon itself. I wanted to create videos that were 100% whatever my mind wanted to create, without worry of what people would think. In essence, I wanted it to be a pure recreation of my emotions and creative ability, which has no become something so ugly and unrecognisable to who I am, that it’s beginning to worry me.</p><p name="597f" id="597f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I thought it would be cultured, entertaining and perhaps a little satirical. Instead, it was evolved into a hate-filled, recreation of what it means to be a little Hitler, spouting off. </p><p name="c691" id="c691" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, there is still beauty in that, because it is me. Ultimately, I think it has exposed all the irrational hate and anger that I have, built up within me. The good news is that it gives me the ability to examine it and work with it. It’s a humbling experience that I can only appreciate. Arguably, most of my videos have to do with women. I think I have a problem with women, that stem from my experiences with dating, from my high-school experiences, and particularly, my own broken relationship with my sole mother who raised me.</p><p name="995c" id="995c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s also another area I’ve being struggle with as well: life as an abstinent soul. Admittedly, in most contexts, it could be said that I take abstinence to an extreme. I’ve cut out caffeine in my life, as well as alcohol, gluten and just about anything that could be considered negative in any context, and it’s hard. You don’t truly realise how dependent you are on these things, until you stop taking them. I almost always drink on the weekends, and it’s so difficult to avoid consuming gluten, because it’s in everything. </p><p name="4a67" id="4a67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My guilt pleasure nowadays is lemon honey ginger. That’s it. Oh, and I like cheese n’ stuff. My diet consists of churned fruit and vegetable, also known as a smoothie, as well various meats. Who knows, maybe my body is going into withdrawal. </p><p name="24fe" id="24fe" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="578e" id="578e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="4a9b" id="4a9b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
