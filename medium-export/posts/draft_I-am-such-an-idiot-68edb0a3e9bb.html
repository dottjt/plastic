It also seems kind of lame. Then following your inactivity,  you begin comparing yourself to others who have continued to whack the moles and can seemingly hit more moles than you.</p><p name="e23e" id="e23e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hatred. The confusion. The hopelessness.  </p><p name="7b49" id="7b49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet no matter what you do, the game is constantly running. Billions of other players, hitting those same damn moles that you just can’t quite convince yourself of. </p><p name="1723" id="1723" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose I like to view recovery as a trial and error experience. I doubt anyone actually knows what they’re actually doing, yet we somehow get better and more refined overtime. Ultimately we all just put faith into our own ideas and if others following, then so be it. </p><p name="9c5a" id="9c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess I’d had a bit of a realisation about myself. It’s interesting how many epiphanies that you can have about yourself and yet still discover that you’ve only scrapped the surface.</p><p name="f9af" id="f9af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My biggest issue, at least as recognisable for the time being, is that my mind likes to make assumptions. </p><p name="c73b" id="c73b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember reading The Four Agreements and one of the main tenets is not to make assumptions. Of course, they don’t really explain how, though certainly it became obvious to me sometime this weekend. </p><p name="853f" id="853f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe it is a trust issue and I believe it is something that I picked up from my mother. It’s the reason why I’m a prime candidate for U.S. State propaganda and I have a difficult time with Facebook.</p><p name="8973" id="8973" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The moment I see something, someone more “accomplished” than me, my mind processes it, generalises it and then hooks my consciousness in. I don’t know, maybe it’s something everyone does. </p><p name="143c" id="143c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly I know it’s because my mother does this in her mind on a whole new level. Her mind is like a jaded cage, full of bad experiences that she projects onto the world before her. </p><p name="caa6" id="caa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though the main reason comes down to a lack of communication. It’s like a downward spiral. I don’t tell her anything, which prompts her to make generalisations about what I do, which creates this hate which solidifies this notion that I’m certainly never going to tell you anything in the future.  </p><p name="8de5" id="8de5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I’m sure it’s much deeper than that. Observing her slew of bad relationships and her Asian parent  is probably what closed me up as a child. </p><p name="7843" id="7843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless, this all stems from the fact that she’s incredibly judgemental of what I do tell her. So I stopped. I didn’t want to deal with the emotional abuse.</p><p name="be01" id="be01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my small epiphany, I also realised that regardless of what anyone does, I am responsible for who I am and I should be responsible for who I am. </p><p name="9513" id="9513" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What made my first relationship so difficult, was because I felt she wouldn’t tell me anything. With that said, I believe it is because I did the exact same thing as my mother as she has to me, which is almost tragic when I come to think about it. </p><p name="be4a" id="be4a" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="0f54" id="0f54" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="a69c" id="a69c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
