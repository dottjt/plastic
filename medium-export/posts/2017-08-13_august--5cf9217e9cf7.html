Yet the hyper-realism is real, and I don’t think I quite care.</p><p name="df79" id="df79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nations on the verge of war. Assets redefining unaffordable. Credit strife well-beyond it’s design. Scandal excessive. Stressed beyond reasonable contention. Towering mega-corporations.</p><p name="18c4" id="18c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, and how they handle our lives like a bunch of intoxicated river geese, dally on the fine-swine of industrial water caress.</p><p name="defe" id="defe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Surreptitious and divide.</p><p name="9103" id="9103" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s both a nightmare, as well as a wonderful leisure in disguise — sour in the blaart candy which distorts our world with a tick-tock twist. Certainly, I doubt any of us will be able to taste the difference.</p><p name="cb70" id="cb70" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Lower those expectations honey, and watch those candles rise.”</p><p name="acd3" id="acd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My fucking gosh. The internet.</p><p name="e26f" id="e26f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The overload is real, and yet the information is questionable. Almost none of it RELEVANT to our well-being, even in-amongst the TARTARE volume, SPLURGE against a banquet of knowledge and restitution BEGGING us for our ATTENTION.</p><p name="472b" id="472b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This despicable entity which both scars and pleasures at a constant rhyme, delegating responsibility to an algorithm even which our brightest minds run clueless to comprehend.</p><p name="ecaa" id="ecaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe that’s why I’m a coder.</p><p name="a30c" id="a30c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Surely, my inner curiosity has deceived me into thinking I can decipher this digital mess and restore some sense of sanity to this world. H A HA AH</p><p name="c1d7" id="c1d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, it’s what the machine wants you to think and as I dig deeper into the syntax and binary thinking — I merely find myself facilitating the dirty smudge of electronic evil which powers these strings tangling our souls, suffocating our ability to retain culture beyond the ancient relics of last night’s Snapchat feed.</p><p name="e69b" id="e69b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The change is real, and it is moving exponentially towards something unknown. It is the show with no host, in which we all lose relevance and our blur gathers scum, like a cum stain with bad intentions.</p><p name="989c" id="989c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s as if our entire notion of reality is being driven by this childish thought that we’ve all been programmed to believe, because we’re all too stupid to unplug ourselves from the gluttony fuelling our daily motion.</p><p name="1ff5" id="1ff5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, the less-than stellar fact is that we’re adapting. We’re adapting to this machine which controls our lives, because we’re eager to survive — some more, come thrive.</p><p name="8c06" id="8c06" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Kill the animal. Drink the blood. Sell it for more.”</p><p name="838a" id="838a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It taught you well.</p><p name="39d8" id="39d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, I know you absolutely fucking love it, and I know — oh yes, I fucking know — that you want to live long enough to witness it all end, and watch as your own reality tears you down, and rips into your elemental constitution, relieving you of deprivation which clouds your mind.</p><p name="7f73" id="7f73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Go on.</p><p name="67a1" id="67a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fuck you too.</p><p name="af10" id="af10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose the interesting thing is that while the machine doesn’t experience fear or insolence, we are expected to compete with it as an equal partner. It’s sort of like that super-model partner you’ll never have, for in this reality we are merely seven out of tens’, and it’s this lack of leverage that sends tingles down my spine.</p><p name="b257" id="b257" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thankfully, there’s a forum for that — so thank you machine for your resounding empathy!</p><p name="5722" id="5722" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though perhaps the machine is designed to make us into better human beings. To exploit us by teaching us to be more efficient. Smarter, more empathetic, more wildly ambitiously than lice — as we crutch aimlessly to the weakness our hearts profess to us on a daily basis.</p><p name="c6b1" id="c6b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cigarettes. Coffee. Pornography.</p><p name="b53e" id="b53e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your life certainly does love you well.</p><p name="f225" id="f225" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a journey we are all losing, as we dwindle to the gargantuan might of the information pyramid. Only you just lost your job last week, and now you feel like a half-baked porcupine, with all it’s needles ripped out and assorted for the quill factory.</p><p name="ab38" id="ab38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The death is slow and reassuring.</p><p name="f0bf" id="f0bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, we have no choice, nor is there any dignity in having any choice at this stage. No amount of love, hate or physical exertion to shift the machine away from it’s insistent creation, tumbling around, gathering what little left of the world around us, cusp in the recycle bin of it’s directive.</p><p name="5076" id="5076" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here we are.</p><p name="1dbf" id="1dbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the 13th of August 2017.</p><p name="aa3c" id="aa3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">And the gradual decay is here to stay.</p></div></div></section>
