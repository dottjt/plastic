(edit)</h3><p name="6d96" id="6d96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There’s a disturbing transformation that takes place in the midst of a job hunt.</p><p name="8a4f" id="8a4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…a childish trickery of tantric madness, designed to compel and destroy with an infinite series of instrument smiles and guaranteed handshakes. The interview process: a killing-field of deception that devolves into a clandestine game of spy vs spy, apostle to the perversion and secrecy that drives us all into unauthorised sickness.</p><p name="b64c" id="b64c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the unemployed, we fraternising perception with a sharp and distasteful claw, ripping and tearing through the lonely assumptions our recruiters sure would love to know. </p><p name="b301" id="b301" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not that they could. The game is far too evolved to allow for such discrepancies in this self-delusion we employ as humble servants for the consciously inebriated. They’re merely recruiters after all, not keen followers of Christ or dedicated monks to the enlightenment of false appearances. Instead, we all push the same paper and swallow the same undetermined prescriptions, to a cash reward that speaks louder than the unrelenting outcomes of an oblivious society.</p><p name="c171" id="c171" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yes, I can do everything. In fact, I can prove it to you right now, if you’d just let me hold and filter the judgement trickling from the manic distrust sweating from your FRET hands.” Maybe it’s an obsession that borders on insanity, though perhaps it’s our task to ensure the insanity doesn’t become so… delicately contrived. </p><p name="8f24" id="8f24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Drull repetition teaches us to write in ways that only dreams could possibly imagine. Oh, the flourish and sunder, whispering worship upon the knowledge of an unknown craft. Characters with exorbitant requirements exclaiming everything from nutritional  frost and embedded solutions, to a promising landscape of digital pyramids and benevolent pharos, all within walking distance as far as the eye can see. </p><p name="0562" id="0562" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wistful intelligence conjuring magic. Flashy figures deficient with hope. It’s beauty, really. When you examine the irrational exuberance and arrogance that comes from the end of an era, staring you right in the face in the daring and passionless heartache finding solace in the brash uncertainty we assured would be squeaky clean. </p><p name="21d1" id="21d1" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I am bleeding. The words are covered in red and white, and while my vision has been reduced to a bare concoction of slithering affection, I am certain to be die before the sympathetic hysteria drowning me in laws admissible to the circumstances ahead.” </p><p name="cfe1" id="cfe1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I cannot say for sure what happens to our consciousness as we seek employment, however there’s a certain addiction to the unpretending hope at our disposal. That bump of indetermination. Those initial weeks of arcane wizardry. All bringing with it a kind of grind to the fingers we become fond. We all become happy children in our search, fostered in the care and shining aluminium of our intuition; an abiding misery that chomps and paralyses upon the capricious divine we so heartily promote without consequence.</p><p name="29fc" id="29fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then all of a sudden, you get really good at the writing and the leverage simply falls into place. You become a button pusher. Acrowd pleaser. You realise it’s a lot easier to program and discriminate, rather than clean the smear dripping pie from the delicious ambition you cultivate in a stationary pertinence, slapping wildly like a wet fish in your face.</p><p name="8020" id="8020" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then as you look down upon your laptop, you notice your time has become sparse. The watch on your hand melts into a quackery and devolves into an uncomprehensible taunt, repeating within a full range of exclamation. </p><p name="6a3d" id="6a3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s been two hours and you’ve written your 15th cover letter. Anew record in the impeccable regurgitation of neuronal relativity, chained to a vision you cannot quite see. Public Relations. Communications. Digital something-or-rather. Who really knows what it all means. What you do know is that more is better, dripping from a chalice clumsily spilling all over the virtue you sold as sin. </p><p name="aa84" id="aa84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the rush however, you realise the hunt is more than just survival. Rather, it becomes a game of wonky affirmation. You begin applying for jobs you don’t really want, jobs  you barely qualify for, to bend and extort the imagination crying fallacy in the misinterpretation bleeding your soul. In a vain attempt to convince the world around, you yourself become the centre of attention in a circle-jerk you allege you cannot recollect. </p><p name="13f4" id="13f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then the hunger sets in.</p><p name="f50e" id="f50e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You view jobs like raw pieces of meat, to be consumed and squandered. You forget what all the fuss was about, cannibalising anything and everything that comes your way, receiving calls upon calls for jobs provided cheap on the dollar, to see how far you can mould their world of demands, to break them and watch them crumble. </p><p name="7ee7" id="7ee7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You ask for more, pretending to want less. You hold them accountable for their lies and you rummage through the garbage espoused in cheap linen, tying their hands behind their backs. It’s silly, we know. But it’s vicious without the serenity. Pure bliss. </p><p name="47ef" id="47ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh please, do you know? </p><p name="9459" id="9459" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">PS: Frictionless scramble. It’s my job to produce insecurity. </p></div></div></section>
