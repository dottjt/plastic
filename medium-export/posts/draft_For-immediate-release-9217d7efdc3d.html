Simply, when our minds are in a bad place and are not functioning as intended, it can limit our ability to comprehend more effective mental health strategies.</p><p name="6ba4" id="6ba4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, our mental illness can be thought of a series of incomprehensible abstractions which we have built over time on-top of each other, which we are now trying to dissect and pull apart.</p><p name="17a7" id="17a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only way we can progress is by gradually peeling away these layers so that we can access more effective techniques. A mental health guide can be seen as the best we can manage for the time being, providing us with the chance to understand ourselves and change.</p><p name="c1cc" id="c1cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With a mental health guide we can learn all the basic cognitive and theoretical skills to understand and control our emotions, along with all the other skills and understandings a person with adequate mental health can expect.</p><p name="fbab" id="fbab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is from this perspective that mental health guides can serve as an amazing starting point in your mental health journey.</p><p name="5abf" id="5abf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the reason why I decided to write this mental health guide was to demonstrate that there are no easy or reliable paths to understanding how our mental illness functions.</p><p name="9b68" id="9b68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not as an opportunity to discourage, however as an opportunity to help these struggles and understand how we must adjust our approach, which I felt was lacking from most other guides.</p><p name="3abc" id="3abc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, this guide aims to illustrate many of the pitfalls that people will face within their own mental health journey, so as to avoid the frustrating series of trial and error experiences of understanding our mental illness.</p><p name="1769" id="1769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is perplexing why most mental health guides do not even attempt to address this struggle, considering our struggle to understand and integrate these concepts form our primary obstacle.</p><p name="5038" id="5038" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, a large majority of guides tend to outline a number of steps we must take, which the guide assumes we will simply carry out, sequentially, without resistance.</p><p name="edfb" id="edfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the reason why has to do with the compromise that mental health guides have to “work” with your non-functioning mind.</p><p name="0050" id="0050" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, mental health guides function no different to mental illness.</p><p name="7632" id="7632" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first step of any mental health guide is to get you to suspend your disbelief. When you suspend your disbelief, you open up your mind to new ideas.</p><p name="759b" id="759b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This idea of disbelief is important, because mental illness is largely a disbelief. Disbelief is an</p><p name="57a8" id="57a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you talk to a psychologist or a doctor, you may almost instantly suspend your disbelief based on their title alone. It is important to note that this largely depends on your own personal preference.</p><p name="b11e" id="b11e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you distrust for authority, you may fail to suspend your disbelief when talking to a psychologist or doctor, and this may be part of the reason why you are reading this mental health guide.</p><p name="9f15" id="9f15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the difficulty with mental illness is that we can become particularly cynical and resistant to adopting new ideas, which is precisely why mental health guides spend a lot of time trying to suspend your disbelief.</p><p name="fb19" id="fb19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By not mentioning the struggle inherent within our mental health journey, authors can ignite an immeasurable amount of hope and passion, though unfortunately it is not an honest representation of what you can expect, which is why people end up in frustration and despair.</p><p name="7c25" id="7c25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The question is: how can you convey and maintain hope, while being honest about the fact that the infinite wisdom that is the mental health guide will often fail as a mental health strategy?</p><p name="c4a2" id="c4a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now this kind of suspension of disbelief isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For those paralyzed by cynicism and mental illness, it is an attractive option and ironically, an option they are most vulnerable to, along with cult religion and obsessive attachment.</p><p name="2279" id="2279" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you have not yet noticed, mental illness also functions by suspending your disbelief.</p><p name="4ca8" id="4ca8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What this ultimately tells us is that there is very little difference between mental illness and met</p><p name="10b1" id="10b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">mental illness and mental health guides are more-or-less the same thing. What you suspend your disbelief to</p><p name="b17d" id="b17d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What this ultimately means is that mental health guides do not break the cycle of mental illness. Rather, you merely replace your undesirable symptoms with desirable ones, because it is impossible to have control over yourself when you’ve limited your ability to think, especially when it relies on faith.</p><p name="232d" id="232d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, there is also the paradox mental illness also functions by suspending your disbelief.</p><p name="40ad" id="40ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other paradox of mental health guides is that</p><p name="5ce1" id="5ce1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only issue is that true mental health isn’t about having faith in belief.</p><p name="f642" id="f642" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you may tell, there</p><p name="24a2" id="24a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately mental illness also functions by suspending your disbelief and limiting your ability to think. This means that even though we may now be happy and confident, it is not real because we now become dependent on these ideas, which ends up being no different to our mental illness.</p><p name="4357" id="4357" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this sense,</p><p name="0527" id="0527" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What effectively happens is that we periodically return to our mental illness and focus all our attention on the symptoms, rather than the actual cause of our mental illness.</p><p name="1066" id="1066" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While a mental health guide can help you become more confident and self-aware, mental health itself isn’t about having confidence or happiness. These are merely side-effects of having influence over your own ability to think, which mental health guides, along with mental illness, actively try to suppress.</p><p name="f0ff" id="f0ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Essentially what this means is that any healthy, autonomous and effective mind cannot be guided and is the reason why mental health guides are no different from being mentally ill.</p><p name="8aaa" id="8aaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now the good news is that since your mind is neither healthy, effective, nor autonomous, so mental health guides aren’t so bad.</p><p name="01a0" id="01a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">you’re probably open to be further guided in the hope that you one day may become better.</p><p name="bf88" id="bf88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In essence, by taking this guide, you as vulnerable person, has decided to take a chance with this guide, by allowing me to shape the way you think and feel, in the hope that you can break free from your existing thinking.</p><p name="ecdb" id="ecdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, not all hope is lost. Now that you understand the limitations of mental health guides, you may now understand how they can help you.</p><p name="0df3" id="0df3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only issue is that they don’t work and that they usually lead to dependency and in most cases, further mental illness.</p><p name="c106" id="c106" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Usually the reason we approach mental health guides is because we feel as if we have nothing to lose. By taking a mental health guide, we entrust in the author to influence and teach us the perspectives and skills necessary to be functional, whether they may be or not.</p><p name="86eb" id="86eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Meditation works in the same way as mental health guides, except in a more direct way. They aim to “suppress” (suppress isn’t the right word, but relevant for the context of your understanding) your ability to think, in a much more direct way.</p><p name="396b" id="396b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Except this is a good thing, and a great area of misunderstanding for people with mental illness. Mental health is precisely about being able to suppress (or in other terms, guide) yourself</p><p name="d828" id="d828" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, it’s about having a balance and this is also part of the reason why guides don’t work. They don’t provide a balance, and achieving this balance is your responsibility.</p><p name="25d2" id="25d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is part of what makes perspective work, and also not work. It is possible to gain perspective by focusing on your mental illness, however that would not be helpful. In essence, we choose what we want to think and feel.</p><p name="3561" id="3561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is alternative to situations where a person becomes desperate enough to believe anything, leading to cult religion or obsessive love, so maybe this kind of suppression isn’t so bad, if it may eventually lead to an individual thinking for themselves.</p><p name="1b3b" id="1b3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, without the suppression, you’ll simply think what I’m saying is bullshit.</p><p name="177f" id="177f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the point of view of a symptom, mental health guides largely provide you with all the answers that you’re looking for. They explain why you get sad, how your beliefs and emotions function, as well as how you can change them.</p><p name="81e7" id="81e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, if you can understand why mental health guides do not work, you may learn to understand why your mental illness works.</p><p name="deff" id="deff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From this perspective it makes perfect sense to pursue a mental health guide. By understanding what is wrong with you, you can then correct this perceived wrongness.</p><p name="0140" id="0140" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue is that mental illness runs much deeper than the symptoms we are experiencing, which is to say that mental illness is also a problem of perception, as much as it is these symptoms.</p><p name="ce06" id="ce06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The answers to your questions are merely distractions, yet you’re convinced you must have these answers in order for you to function.</p><p name="531b" id="531b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, it’s a lot like saying that crutches don’t work. Sure, if your legs are damaged or injured, then crutches can help you to move. However no matter how good you get at using crutches, it simply is not the same as walking without them.</p><p name="cce9" id="cce9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understandably walking with and without crutches have a lot in common, and the primary reason we use crutches is to eventually build up the strength to be able to walk without them, however</p><p name="bcda" id="bcda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hard part, is that only you can decide whether you can stop using these crutches and this is where most your struggle will reside.</p><p name="fee8" id="fee8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like anyone else, I have no clear idea how one would, or should, describe a state of mental health or mental illness, to someone else suffering from mental illness.</p><p name="78ef" id="78ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I can provide however, is an estimation of what I think would be helpful to those with mental illness, based on my own experiences and understanding of mental illness.</p><p name="f2ff" id="f2ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This guide aims to provide you with two different things. It aims to provide a theoretical framework for you to understand how your mind works in relations to your mental illness, in addition to a number of practical conventions to direct you where you need to go.</p><p name="f377" id="f377" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I teach you the theory, and then tell you what to do with it and how you can incorporate it into your everyday life. Nothing radical or out-of-the-ordinary.</p><p name="1bbb" id="1bbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This guide takes a proactive understanding of mental health, in that we ultimately have the power and ability to control and influence our mental state.</p><p name="fe0e" id="fe0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This ties in with the philosophy towards our mental health within this guide: mental illness and mental health are really no different to anything else in life.</p><p name="6dd8" id="6dd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, they are areas of study and observation which inherit a broad range of skills and understandings, no different if you were to learn to play piano or martial arts.</p><p name="7b8a" id="7b8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more you study and observe your mental illness, the better you will become at recognising your own thoughts and behaviours, and the less it will come to affect your life, if at all.</p><p name="2c14" id="2c14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, this is not to say that it is an easy task. Needless to say, I’m sure we are both already aware of how difficult and crushing mental illness can be. I merely hope to outline a viable path which many have taken before.</p><p name="3b04" id="3b04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite the difficulty, the good news is that you now have direction as to what you can do. You now understand that your mental illness can be understood, and that it must be understood in order to overcome it.</p><p name="ec9c" id="ec9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the very least, this is the premise and approach of this guide, which I am trying to convey to you. If you’re itching to figure this stuff out, as if your life were to depend on it, then this guide will do you wonders.</p><p name="ce35" id="ce35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, if you’re looking for some kind of quick fix, some kind of solution which will permanently zap you into place, then I’m afraid it simply doesn’t exist, unless if you’re willing to deal with the side-effects of prescription medication.</p><p name="a92d" id="a92d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">More than anything, it can help to think of your mental health as an investment of time and effort that will set you up for the rest of your life. With a clear mind you will be able to do more of what you love, without the fear, guilt and sadness holding you down.</p><p name="191c" id="191c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">1 Understanding is a starting point for mental health</p><p name="79ee" id="79ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This comprehensive guide is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of how mental illness is created.</p><p name="798f" id="798f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a process I recommend for all individuals struggling with mental illness, as it will allow for a high standard of mental health.</p><p name="8089" id="8089" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mental health is representative of one or more perspectives, taken from a wide range of different ideas and points of view.</p><p name="07ec" id="07ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mental health is a spectrum of perspective.</p><p name="7d0d" id="7d0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is important that we view mental health as a standard, rather than an exception or something ideal, otherwise we risk distorting our ability to maintain control over our points of view.</p><p name="4aa4" id="4aa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is no different to mental illness, which also represents one or more perspectives and should not be qualified as something bad or horrible.</p><p name="57ca" id="57ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we use words like exceptional, ideal and positive, we qualify our perspectives and instead of taking them impersonally, we instead form attachments and biases towards them.</p><p name="1d8d" id="1d8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perspectives do not have qualities: qualities are self-created descriptions we use to justify or condemn our perspectives, to influence and manipulate our behaviours and actions.</p><p name="580e" id="580e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Likewise, mental illness should not be it is just another perspective we have adopted, unwillingly, unknowingly or unfortunately.</p><p name="56d8" id="56d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mental health and description.</p><p name="0b78" id="0b78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’ll explore in more depth why we create these qualities, however we largely use</p><p name="29dc" id="29dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">which we use as a coping mechanism to process our perspectives.</p><p name="778b" id="778b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue with qualifying our perspectives is that we</p><p name="4999" id="4999" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This bias contributes towards cultivating delusional or inaccurate points of view, which make it difficult to critically examine and change our perspectives.</p><p name="0e46" id="0e46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Establishing Mental health conventions.</p><p name="2c6d" id="2c6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This has a number of effects such as impairing our ability to reason with our thoughts and emotions, as well as spur unnecessary doubt, subjectivity and uncertainty within our own minds.</p><p name="2b38" id="2b38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This highlights the importance of learning to adopt and maintain neutral attitudes and perspectives, so that we can have more influence over o</p><p name="431c" id="431c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This represents one of the many conventions that we will be exploring within this guide, so that we can better understand how our mental illness functions and change our perspective on life.</p><p name="9fcb" id="9fcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2 Introducing abstraction.</p><p name="3573" id="3573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Terms such as ‘mental illnesses, ‘mental health’ and ‘perspective’ should not be thought of as concrete, tangible concepts. They are merely ideas and conventions which are vague abstractions, created and defined within the context of this guide.</p><p name="2fbb" id="2fbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A large part of our mental illness relates to the way we interpret and value words. In our dysfunction and mental illness, we misconstrue the role of words as concepts and representations of ideas, rather than as a source of truth.</p><p name="4758" id="4758" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the word ‘cat’ relates to an animal in our mind, the word ‘cat’ is merely an abstraction of the black lines you are currently viewing on your screen. This is to say that our words, much like our qualities and descriptions, are entirely self-created.</p><p name="f527" id="f527" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The importance of abstraction.</p><p name="4729" id="4729" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This distinction is useful within the context of mental illness, as mental illness itself is an abstraction of the ideas and conventions we have of reality.</p><p name="caec" id="caec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mental illness is an abstraction we have created which allows us to hide and obscure our perspective, which we view as an accurate depiction of reality, rather than as an impersonal side-effect of misunderstanding.</p><p name="9fa1" id="9fa1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These abstractions are where we keep all our projected stories and insecurities of who we are, as well as all the negative shit in our minds.</p><p name="b5a6" id="b5a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, by understanding and eventually dissolving these abstractions, we can learn to think critically about our mental illness and no longer allow it to affect us personally.</p><p name="4992" id="4992" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Example of abstraction.</p><p name="f9c9" id="f9c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One example of this abstraction will be apparent when we express gratitude. Usually these gratitude exercises get you to write what you are most grateful for along the lines of “I am grateful for ______”.</p><p name="8cbe" id="8cbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The exercise works because it trains you to redirect your focus, something which we will explore in later chapters. One of the traps we fall into with these kinds of exercises is that we confuse the wording for the feeling.</p><p name="8080" id="8080" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gratitude is a feeling.

It is an approach which tackles the foundation first, because we continue towards function.</p><p name="1bdb" id="1bdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, our misunderstanding of how mental illness is created should be viewed as the resistance we have towards adopting all these positive qualities, rather than view our mental illness as the resistance itself.</p><p name="c3f1" id="c3f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ambition, health and happiness are all common objectives which we strive for when we are mentally functioning, that we mask with our mental illness.

In other words, the conscious mind plays a large part in how we remain aware of the world around us, and additionally, how we perceive reality.</p><p name="04fa" id="04fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can use the conscious mind to become more or less aware of reality by using our focus and attention. This ability to remain focused is affected by a number of different factors, in particular, the state of our mental health.</p><p name="7c3b" id="7c3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In many ways, it can help to think of the conscious mind as a cursor we can control on a computer screen.

More crucially, that the conscious mind can only function within the present moment.</p><p name="14a8" id="14a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This often contradicts with the way we feel, especially in relation to our memories. Depending on where we place our awareness through our focus and attention, it can feel as if we are reliving moments from our past.</p><p name="1643" id="1643" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Often there are natural cases where we cannot maintain control over our conscious mind through our focus and attention. This occurs when we are feeling tired, or perhaps when we are feeling alert and excited. These aspects are also affected by our diet, along with a number of different things.</p><p name="2a97" id="2a97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conscious mind actively creates reality.</p><p name="30ef" id="30ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While the conscious mind may only seem like a passive magnifying glass, allowing us to utilise our focus and attention to change our awareness, in reality, our awareness is the only mechanism we have to process reality.</p><p name="b5e5" id="b5e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is to say that the conscious mind plays a fundamental and very active role in creating reality, rather than something which is merely exposed to the world around us. It also emphasises the power of the individual to change the way they think, feel and perceive the world.</p><p name="5f81" id="5f81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Conscious mind gives us control.</p><p name="a615" id="a615" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The conscious mind is important because it is our only means of healthy delegation. It is a gift that comes with our intelligence as a species, which when neglected, effectively forces us to rely on more primitive ways of relating to the world.</p><p name="0833" id="0833" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of what causes mental illness is when we start treating the mind as a passive participant to reality, therefore assuming that we are subjected to our misery and all the horrible things in our life, rather reflecting on the reality that we are actually creating, processing and promoting this misery in our heads.</p><p name="b8d3" id="b8d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is also to say that effective change begins with the conscious mind, which is why we are going to learn to use it to our advantage to aapproach our mental illness.</p><p name="0511" id="0511" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the conscious mind… disappears.</p><p name="39e4" id="39e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem with the above is that it all becomes completely irrelevant the moment we find ourselves in a state of mental illness. The conscious mind is effectively disabled or hidden from view and our ideas of focus and attention seem curiously absent.</p><p name="6826" id="6826" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the course of this guide, we will be exploring how the conscious mind is distorted and our ability to maintain focus and perspective is hindered. In other words, the ways in which we abuse and neglect the conscious mind.</p><p name="a72a" id="a72a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How the conscious mind has evolved.</p><p name="f949" id="f949" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It can help to look back at how the human brain has developed evolutionarily over time, to get a better sense of how our conscious control came about.</p><p name="e399" id="e399" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the beginning there was the reptilian brain, which dictated basic function such as survival instinct and other primitive responses. The mammalian brain began to develop with the arrival of the first mammals, allowing us to record memories and develop unique behaviours depending on our emotions. Lastly, the neocortex developed is the latest development of the brain present in humans, which is involved with higher functions such as sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and language.</p><p name="c4ac" id="c4ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While consciousness is an aspect that involves the entire brain as a whole, aspects of our consciousness such as our self-awareness rely on many functions contained within the neocortex. Functions such as planning, introspection, learning, abstraction and developing beliefs.</p><p name="825f" id="825f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are all core functions which essentially make us human; functions which other species lack or have a limited capacity to reason with. Often in neglecting the conscious mind, we end up consulting with the mammalian or reptilian brain, to dictate how we live our lives.</p><p name="e8d5" id="e8d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How we revert to devolution of the conscious mind.</p><p name="63bc" id="63bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather than using our conscious mind to simply act on our intentions, we instead use fear and emotional manipulation to try to dictate the way we think, feel and behave. We use fear and reward to motivate and condition ourselves. It is something will explore later.</p><p name="3fb2" id="3fb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, the modern reality of the 21st century does not allow us to neglect the neocortex, otherwise we’d be neglecting the thousands of years of civilization that we created with it. In fact, we call people who abuse or neglect the neocortex as being mentally ill; incompatible with the society we live in.</p><p name="d7bd" id="d7bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How the conscious mind relates to mental illness.</p><p name="998b" id="998b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Mental illness” is a term we prescribe to severe episodes of mental dysfunction, because we lose such a level of conscious control over ourselves, that it severely hinders our ability to dictate any mental function required to sustain ourselves in the modern world.</p><p name="1e08" id="1e08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mental illness is as much a state of mind, as it is a function, which limits our conscious experience to focus only on our feelings of trauma, obsession, hopelessness and emotional pain, whether real or perceived.</p><p name="25e4" id="25e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It makes us feel hopeless and incapable, sometimes believing that we deserve and that these feelings have been projected onto us, which is what happens when we focus on our feelings, emotions and even thoughts to delegate our reality.</p><p name="6a33" id="6a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, it is not that we are hopeless or incapable. It is simply that we are unaware of our ability to think consciously of ourselves. It is like trying to use a computer with the mouse disconnected. The system will continue running, however it is running independent of your own intention.</p><p name="fd34" id="fd34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consciousness conclusion.</p><p name="8d74" id="8d74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you may tell, consciousness plays a central theme in this mental health course and over the following chapters, I hope to demonstrate the ways with which we abuse, misuse and neglect our conscious mind. In some circles, the conscious mind is referred to as a form of self-awareness. Both terms are interchangeable.</p><p name="d9db" id="d9db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the course of this tutorial, we want to understand how we direct our consciousness to focus on the thoughts and behaviours which promote mental illness, while also learning about how we can use our consciousness to remain aware.</p><p name="921b" id="921b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why we neglected the conscious mind.</p><p name="69cf" id="69cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the issue is that we were not brought up to fully utilise the conscious mind. As mentioned early, we were instead taught to use fear to control and influence others, particularly through example. Our parents would threaten or reward us depending on how we would behave and it’s how we learn to interact with the world.</p><p name="e4ff" id="e4ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Often this neglect is unintentional; a product of how we were brought up and taught to think. It is an area which we will explore further into the guide.</p><p name="1a30" id="1a30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What makes this all so dangerous is that we end up developing these behaviours based on emotion, rather than out of the true intent of our consciousness. When we live so long without consciousness, we simply think it is normal and so we suffer emotionally out of convention.</p><p name="70f2" id="70f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we remain unconscious to our behaviours, we become incredibly impressionable to the world. We become vulnerable to our own actions and the world around us and it’s a very dangerous position to be in.</p><p name="0a9b" id="0a9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One consequence of this neglect is that we spend a lot of time superficially coping with our mental illness, rather than truly understanding why we do it.</p><p name="3067" id="3067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What this usually does is further exacerbate and exaggerate our mental illness, under the false impression that it is helping us, in world where we become ever absorbed into our mental illness and harmful behaviours. It is an ugly cycle that I’m sure many of us are familiar with.</p><p name="8ef2" id="8ef2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One very important question you must ask yourself is at what point you does a person become mentally ill. Is it when they lose consciousness of their behaviours? Is it when their behaviours become so exaggerated over-time that they become considered neurotic?</p><p name="d85d" id="d85d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most people are unaware.</p><p name="7fee" id="7fee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For starters, a large majority of people are unaware of their conscious mind. This is not to say that people are entirely unconscious, however that they have their consciousness limited on only certain aspects of their mind.</p><p name="a341" id="a341" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, that they are not truly in-control of themselves. They simply follow their behaviours, thoughts and emotions based on potentially flawed reasoning, and is how most people live their lives, simply because it is adequate for most day-to-day circumstances.</p><p name="4f94" id="4f94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is especially true as children where there is little responsibility and our ability to experience is limited. However as our perception of reality grows, simply relying on our thoughts and emotions to reason with life becomes insufficient, particularly when we experience trauma.</p><p name="5a57" id="5a57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When trauma strikes, our thoughts and emotions completely breakdown and we become desperate and neurotic. Without our consciousness, we are virtually helpless and our desperation usually results in developing mental illness.</p><p name="9286" id="9286" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Emotions/Thoughts incapable of processes trauma.</p><p name="9cc1" id="9cc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trauma has an effect of overwhelming us both emotionally and psychologically. When our coping mechanisms are insufficient, we break down and we fail to function, which is particularly the case when we rely on our thoughts and emotions to influence and perceive the world.</p><p name="00ae" id="00ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In prolonged periods of sadness, our mind can fail to recognise any other alternative points of view, because of how convincing our are in creating that hopeless narrative. Instead of using our conscious mind to distinguish ourselves from these emotions, we instead allow them to become a part of who we are.</p><p name="213a" id="213a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Emotions/thoughts cause rumination.</p><p name="2f43" id="2f43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When preoccupied rumination, we sincerely believe the self-criticism and self-judgement we create in our mind, in the belief that our thoughts are to be trusted to create reason and that we truly must be imperfect and worthless because our thoughts are telling us so.</p><p name="bc85" id="bc85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We put so much trust in our thoughts and emotions to guide us that they end up failing us, because we relinquish our ability to control our mind. It is important to note that this relinquishing of power is usually a gradual erosion.</p><p name="a582" id="a582" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Often when we ruminate, we assume further thinking can help fix our suffering, when in reality it has the affect of making it worse. Shifting our attention on the other hand, is only an ability of the conscious mind, which people take for granted.</p><p name="b9c7" id="b9c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we initially break up with a partner for example, it makes us feel sad. In fact, sadness is perceived as a complete normal emotion to loss. The only issue is that sadness is usually not the only emotion we feel. We may also feel love, angry, jealously, as well as a wide range of different emotions.</p><p name="24f1" id="24f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we have all these different emotions playing around in our mind, we ultimately become confused and behave irrationally. If we are still emotionally attached to this person, it makes it even more difficult not to take our emotions personally and in a lot of cases, we end up using our thoughts to justify our feelings, rather than using them to logically reason with our loss.</p><p name="a3f3" id="a3f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is only one example, however it demonstrates how we skew our thoughts and emotions in truly terrifying ways, to essentially ‘cope’ when trauma has completely overwhelmed our traditional coping mechanisms. We essentially become delusional.</p><p name="d067" id="d067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why we neglect the conscious mind.</p><p name="2e7e" id="2e7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Aside from the fact that many of us were largely brought up to avoid thinking consciously, part of the issues is that consciousness gets a bad wrap.</p><p name="4d6a" id="4d6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not only because most of us have deluded ourselves into believing that we are already conscious, however because consciousness is something that very few people can empathise with. When you’ve been brought up in the world of emotional reactions, this idea of being in-control not only seem implausible, however incongruent with how the world actually functions.</p><p name="3a6b" id="3a6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When people need to be bossed around or shouted at to get anything done, aspects such as fear, happiness and sadness all become very powerful emotions to make things happen. This is something which we’ll touch upon in much greater depth later in the course when we begin talking about beliefs. Certainly, not is all it seems.</p><p name="0c5d" id="0c5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the quote goes: “It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” Which really is the challenge we are facing.</p><p name="3463" id="3463" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the problem is that consciousness is seen as something unnatural, almost forceful. There is this notion in society that our emotions and impulses are natural, as an inherent part of who we are.</p><p name="b57f" id="b57f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Largely however, we disdain our conscious mind because it is something which we struggle with and therefore, dismiss it as being effective. When we struggle with maintaining our diets and with exercising, when we struggle with our thoughts and emotions, we end up blaming our consciousness and dismissing ourselves as being incapable.</p><p name="19f3" id="19f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather than acknowledge that we have a problem, we instead paint consciousness as a kind of unpleasant, overbearing parent which tries and to tell us to do things against our will. Instead of valuing our emotions as something to be appreciated, we instead treat them as if they are a consequence of our flaws as human beings.</p><p name="ac1d" id="ac1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reality of the situation is that most of us have not been taught any mental health skills at all and often attempts to try and teach these skills are shallow and incomprehensible. While we may have engaged in meditation or relaxation exercises in school, the larger context of why it’s important is never truly explored.</p><p name="f89c" id="f89c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, this idea of consciousness is difficult concept for children and young adults to grasp, especially if they are not already suffering and there is no incentive or reason to try alternative ways of thinking. Most prominently, it is not how our peers and our parents usually think and these factors influence us greatly.</p><p name="2b58" id="2b58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a result of this lack of understanding, we end up developing very simplistic models of the mind, most prominently through the kind of emotion-based morality which our parents and peers have used on us: through guilt, shame and whatever people discover is effective for their purposes.</p><p name="2025" id="2025" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, our mental illness and depression so powerful is that it makes us avoid and fear our conscious mind. Think about it. If your mind is solely preoccupied with your trauma, then even thinking about it brings up your trauma and makes you feel afraid.</p><p name="c2d4" id="c2d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly our thoughts and emotions hold a place in our mind. With our thoughts we can reason with the world and our emotions to feel. The big difference is that these things should not be thought of as aspects to drive who we are. They should be thought of as a healthy consequence of our own conscious decisions.</p><p name="46a2" id="46a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a radically different way of thinking about the world which will take a lot of practice, however it is a calm, beautiful experience that provides us with a whole new meaning of what it means to be happy. All that new age holistic bullshit about opening up your mind? Hate to say it, but they were right.</p><p name="0d7e" id="0d7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3 How we create delusion.</p><p name="015f" id="015f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Justifying our delusion. // maybe write about emotional reactions instead?</p><p name="4bd8" id="4bd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we have a slight taste of how we create mental illness, particularly by neglecting and abusing the potential of the conscious mind, we need to dive further into how we do it, in order to get a clearer picture of why we do it.</p><p name="3190" id="3190" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the consequences of our mental illness is that we lose control over our focus and attention. We lose complete confidence in our ability to think and feel. We sort of just go with the flow, allowing our sadness and depression to guide our own lives.</p><p name="50c6" id="50c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we lose control over ourselves, we tend to make the assumption that the outside world is controlling us, and we can begin to externalise and blame the outside world for our condition. All the while, we don’t realise the internal mechanisms which are responsible for the way we feel.</p><p name="d67a" id="d67a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are many different ways we express this externalisation. We say things like “She makes me feel really angry” or “I cannot believe he would treat me like this”. We blame the traffic for how we feel and while our wording may not necessarily be as explicit as those examples, it is implicit in the way we feel.</p><p name="87bc" id="87bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the process of this externalization, we recognise what we commonly call “triggers” which are things external from us which we blame for our negative reactions. Eventually this leads to victim blaming and a range of different</p><p name="7c4d" id="7c4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a lot of cases, we become our own worst trigger, which eventually leads to self-harm and suicide. While triggering is a very real side effect of our trauma, they are a product of our lack of coping mechanisms which with sufficient mental health, can be overcome.</p><p name="2639" id="2639" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It can be frustrating when people tell us that our mental illness is not real and that it’s all in our head. In a sense, it is in our head. However the issue is that it doesn’t feel like it’s in our head; it feels like an integral part of who we are.</p><p name="e104" id="e104" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In many ways, our experience with mental illness isn’t truly or uniquely ours. Rather, it can be thought of a collection of all the terrible traumas, toxic people and unfortunate circumstances that the world has exposed onto you.</p><p name="c7a4" id="c7a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, it is not just you. It is also the broken society that we have all been exposed to, which is only getting worse with each passing day. This is to say that your mental illness is a reflection of the society you live in, rather than inherent part of yourself.</p><p name="6e9e" id="6e9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is only because you have not been able to deal with it, that you have made it a part of yourself. This is a very powerful realisation, because contrary to popular belief, it demonstrates that life is not responsible for the way you feel, only you are.</p><p name="8cf2" id="8cf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, something isn’t quite right here. You may feel differently. You may feel as if the harshness of life actually proves that you couldn’t possible be responsible for your own life, as we have no control over life.</p><p name="b8a4" id="b8a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This however is different from saying that we do not have control over our minds, which dictate how we perceive our own life. It is the reason</p><p name="acb4" id="acb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How our mental illness skews our perception to become pessimist.c</p><p name="64de" id="64de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This comes down to the way we perceive the world if we are cynical vs optimistic.</p><p name="5e21" id="5e21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">puts the power back into our hands. It demonstrates that we are not our mental illness; that we are only a response to it.</p><p name="1c33" id="1c33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By acknowledging that thye have control or you do or imo.</p><p name="5280" id="5280" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the sake of mental illness, life is responsible for the way you feel.</p><p name="f388" id="f388" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, life is not responsible for the way you feel. You conscious mind is<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">.</strong></p><p name="4a97" id="4a97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">8 Breaking away from the delusional mind.</p><p name="2c9d" id="2c9d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“As silly as it may sound, you must first be conscious unconscious of it, which really is to say that it must be maintained and used wisely. When we abuse, misuse or particularly neglect the conscious delusional mind, we risk losing control over it, often entirely forgetting that we have an conscious unconscious mind, which naturally breaks down into mental dysfunction function.”</p><p name="ae8b" id="ae8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a lot that’s incorrect about the above paragraph, however I wanted to draw the parallel between delusion and self-awareness. In many ways, they are two sides of the same coin, dependent on the amount of awareness we might have at any given time.</p><p name="9f7f" id="9f7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Much like our conscious awareness, our delusion is also infallible.</p><p name="f2a5" id="f2a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For most people, it is only once our circumstances become truly sufferable, when we reach such a low with our mental state, that we suddenly become exposed to how surreal we have become.</p><p name="862e" id="862e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a special moment for many people; a moment when they realise that they need to change. The only issue is, they have no idea how. They become so far removed from reality and their own consciousness that they feel stuck. This of course precipitates hopelessness and depression, which further entrenches the cycle.</p><p name="4e9e" id="4e9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hopefully this chapter paints an accurate picture of how mental illness may develop and it truly only scratches the surface of how we create delusion in our lives. I am yet to cover how our beliefs interact with our consciousness, and I hope to dive a little deeper into how we create emotional reactions, among many other things.</p><p name="334c" id="334c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">9 A path for understanding the conscious mind</p><p name="35a1" id="35a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you may now be aware, in order for us to become mentally healthy, we must now focus on how we can become conscious and self-aware.</p><p name="82aa" id="82aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People think that mental health is magic, however our perception of reality is merely dictated by where you put your conscious attention. At the same time, there is something very unsexy about this idea that our mental health is nothing more than developing focus. Part of the issue is that where we place meaning.</p><p name="e7da" id="e7da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We tend to place meaning on the narratives and stories that our thoughts and emotions conjure in our mind. In a sense, our imagination is an aspect of the subconscious mind, which is why we can end up daydreaming when we are bored. It is why we can maintain emotional connections with the characters we see in movies.</p><p name="28cc" id="28cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue with this kind of worship is that we don’t focus on the kinds of things that are actually important: Our emotional well-being. Instead of valuing our emotions like our happiness, we instead value the stories and lies which contribute towards our insecurity about who we think we should be.</p><p name="225c" id="225c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense this narrative gives us hope. When we get upset with our break up, we think that maybe it will work out like it used to. We remain attached to the story that things will be okay. Of course, we don’t realise that we are suffering because our conscious mind is</p><p name="694b" id="694b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In reality there is no meaning in being upset about a break up. There is no significant message in feeling worthless about who you are. It is simply a product of where you put your attention and how you choose to focus that attention from what point of view.</p><p name="3d04" id="3d04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the context of our consciousness, there are a few things we must do if we are to wield it effectively and is how I have structured this mental health course: Precisely, into three different sections.</p><p name="8212" id="8212" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, we must remove the perceived barriers in our mind that interfere with our ability to understand and embrace our consciousness. In particular, the agreements and beliefs we hold in our mind which skew our ability to be conscious. This will make maintaining and developing our conscious mind much, much easier. This covers the first and free section of the course.</p><p name="edfa" id="edfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Secondly, we must learn to control and develop our conscious mind. This means learning to change and focus our attention on different things, perceive events from a variety of different points of view, as well as shrink and grow our consciousness. This section is paid, if you feel that the first section is appropriate for your needs.</p><p name="525a" id="525a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lastly, we must learn how best to maintain the conscious mind so that we can remain in a state of conscious awareness with ourselves. This is perhaps the hardest part of understanding our consciousness, which most of us struggle with.</p><p name="6867" id="6867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the following chapters, I will be covering a number of methods and practices which can help us to lower the barriers in our mind, to allow us to work towards reaching a state of awareness.</p><p name="bda1" id="bda1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the beginning, I will focus less on how we actually practice self-awareness and more about how we can prepare our minds so that we can eventually accept awareness into our lives. This is because we need to uncover and dissolve all the misconceptions, beliefs and ideas in our mind which have contributed towards our mental illness.</p><p name="f10c" id="f10c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you have a significant grasp over how your mind works, we can then slowly begin introducing methods and techniques to explore self-awareness and eventually, complete control over our minds.</p><p name="57da" id="57da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">10 Introducing the concept of clarity.</p><p name="b034" id="b034" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the last chapter I talked about externalization. Part of the reason why we externalize is because we feel like it can provide us with the answers our mind are looking for, however what I believe most people are actually seeking in life is clarity.</p><p name="17fd" id="17fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to talk about this idea of clarity because I believe it is central to what you are desperately seeking in your mind. Usually we tend to have very jaded ways of expressing our desire for clarity. We believe starving ourselves to maintain a certain body image or criticizing ourselves for not being “perfect”, will provide us with clarity, ironically as a means to end our suffering.</p><p name="eecc" id="eecc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chances are that you have never experience clarity in your life. Perhaps it was temporary and based in deception, like the rush you feel when you buy something really shiny and expensive, however very rarely have people experienced true clarity that is most importantly, unconditional.</p><p name="bbe8" id="bbe8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would personally describe clarity as a complete calmness of the mind, where you feel so free that it borders on euphoria. I understand. It comes across as optimistically offensive, if not dangerous and impractical.</p><p name="4ffb" id="4ffb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you feel it, you will know.</p><p name="8966" id="8966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">11 An analogy for understanding clarity.</p><p name="48b1" id="48b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though describing clarity is ultimately meaningless.</p><p name="65b2" id="65b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is that a lot of what we have been taught to be meaningful, such as overthinking and overanalyzing situations, is entirely unnecessary and harmful, while all the misconceptions we have of self-awareness, are completely incorrect.</p><p name="f8c2" id="f8c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To add an even greater layer of irony, all these things which we think will make us ineffective, actually make us incredibly effective at what we want to achieve in life. This is something I will address in the next chapter.</p><p name="9d4a" id="9d4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a more tangible analogy of how clarity works, it can help to explain how heat works.</p><p name="8967" id="8967" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Objects vary in the amount of heat they have. They can have more or less heat. On the contrary, you cannot describe an object in terms of having cold. When an object loses temperature, it’s not because it’s gaining more cold — it’s because it’s losing heat.</p><p name="bf4b" id="bf4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clarity works in a similar fashion. Heat can be compared to all the judgment, negative attitudes, rumination and stress we have within ourselves. Clarity is reached when we reduce all these symptoms in our lives, so that we can be left with a clear mind.</p><p name="4174" id="4174" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some people think that their mental illness might be a result of not having enough happiness or positive influences in their life, when in reality, it is more about reducing</p><p name="2997" id="2997" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is to say that our emotions should be thought of a consequence of our minds. If our minds are clear, we can be emotionally stable, as well as direct our emotions.</p><p name="3e4e" id="3e4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our consciousness functions in very much the same regard. We can measure our consciousness through the amount of awareness we have. It is not that we gain unawareness.</p><p name="ef55" id="ef55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Throughout this course we will address some of the ways we can reduce this so-called “heat”, particularly through understanding our beliefs and agreements. In order to introduce the ideas and beliefs and agreements, we will explore how we commonly create and experience emotional reactions.</p><p name="1994" id="1994" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before then however, let’s return to our fundamental model so that we can better understand how we experience this externalization and in particular, how we experience emotional reactions.</p><p name="daac" id="daac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">12 Understanding our emotional reactions.</p><p name="0d97" id="0d97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Remaining conscious</p><p name="8eb4" id="8eb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I talked about our emotions and thoughts earlier, I didn’t really explain the internal mechanisms as to how they form into delusion. This is something which we will explore now, so let’s return back to our model of the mind.</p><p name="e83f" id="e83f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s take a closer look at what may happen when we experience an emotional reaction.</p><p name="e46f" id="e46f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Emotion provides us with a mechanism to validate our conscious experience. They make us feel dead and alive. When we experience something traumatic, it can result in an emotional response, which we use to validate our reality and more commonly, our identity of who we are.</strong></p><p name="2263" id="2263" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Talk about how we build up through agreements. And these agreements and beliefs are what make us change over time.</p><p name="571a" id="571a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">13 Why we have the power to change.</p><p name="594b" id="594b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you noticed in the last chapter, I described the various aspects of the mind as being an internal part of ourselves. Our emotions. Our thoughts. Our senses. This is because consciousness, our perception of the world and ourselves, is something that lives inside us, rather than outside of us.</p><p name="1d8c" id="1d8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is important that we understand that these mechanisms are internal because to acknowledge that something is within us, is to suggest that it is within our power to control and influence. When we acknowledge that our consciousness is external on the other hand, it delegates power out of our hand. More on this later.</p><p name="309d" id="309d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This internalization really epitomizes the reason why some circles idolise self-awareness as a healing tool: because it allows us to remain conscious and avoid this kind of externalization.</p><p name="1556" id="1556" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the beginning however, it is important that we dismantle and dissolve some of the beliefs and agreements that you have held onto in your mind, which are preventing you from reach clarity. If I asked you to simply empty your mind just by thinking about it, you’d probably have a lot of trouble.</p><p name="e9db" id="e9db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chances are that you have a lot of different thoughts, ideas and emotions rushing through your mind, fighting for your attention. Insecurities, fears and doubt, clouding your mind and suffocating you. In a sense, we will be peeling these layers, one step at a time, so that eventually we can relieve ourselves of these burdens.</p><p name="badd" id="badd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">14 Dismantling our beliefs and agreements.</p><p name="a598" id="a598" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One common fear that people have is that in losing our mental illness in the pursuit for mental health, we actually lose a fundamental part of who we are. This is not true because contrary to popular belief, our mental illness will always be a part of us and is an aspect of our personality that we can return to at any time.</p><p name="ef30" id="ef30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just as mental health is learnt, when we have spent a large portion of our lives in mental illness, it is a very difficult thing to unlearn and for most people, it is something that stays with us forever. However with enough practice with mental health, we can also become comfortable with being mentally healthy and in a way, embrace both worlds if you so choose.</p><p name="ab32" id="ab32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first step in our progression is to dismantle and address some of the agreements and beliefs that we have made about ourselves and the world, which affect our conscious state. We will further explore our model of the mind to see how we distort reality, and try and cover the most common ways with which we deceive ourselves.</p><p name="a344" id="a344" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At some point in this journey you will reach a moment of clarity. It may be early. It may be later. However when you feel it, you’ll feel like the world has lifted from yours shoulders. Chances are however, you will also lose this clarity. Holding onto clarity forms the second part of this course and is another fundamental skill you must master if you are to maintain a certain level of mental health.</p><p name="e312" id="e312" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, we need to dismantle some of the beliefs and</p><p name="507d" id="507d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It helps to think of it as a progression of undoing all the beliefs and</p><p name="36f1" id="36f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the fears</p><p name="7968" id="7968" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each practice has their own pros and cons depending on the situation, however in 99% of daily life, we generally will rely on one technique that keeps us in check.</p><p name="8d5b" id="8d5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consequentially, a lot of the practices and exercises in this course, is more about helping you better understand how your mental illness works, so you can have reassurance in your own ability to be mentally healthy.</p><p name="cc31" id="cc31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re going to dismantle expectations, and all that good stuff.</p><p name="f2a3" id="f2a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">- Using the observational mind.</p><p name="7c96" id="7c96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">15 The dirty secret of maintaining perspective.</p><p name="7eb1" id="7eb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most important thing you can do is maintain your energy and personal power.</p><p name="0f6a" id="0f6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">- dismantling expectations // expectations are merely a side-effect of</p><p name="0e9e" id="0e9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why it’s so hard to maintain perspective — we slowly create millions of agreements and we rebuild the ego again, and again, and again.

Instead it’s all about energy and how we maintain it.</p><p name="da11" id="da11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is to say that we allow our emotions and thoughts to control us and our personal energy. Take revenge or hatred for example. When we hate someone, we think that we are in control of the situation. We are directing our emotions towards a particularly person. On the contrary, that person control you. They control you for as long as you hold onto that hatred.</p><p name="b18d" id="b18d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We use all our energy to do negative things, when we could have focused all that negative energy into making ourselves a better person! We actually learn an incredible amount from the people who hurt us, about human nature and ourselves.</p><p name="2900" id="2900" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s about letting it all go. People assume you need to pack your mind full of information and remember things. The mind isn’t designed for that. Packing your mind full of information is what makes you mentally ill, not mentally healthy.</p><p name="a893" id="a893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Talk about how it’s difficult when we’re tired.

There should be a variety of different resources for you to draw upon.</p><p name="e749" id="e749" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a barrier, perhaps, a standard, which I am enforcing, based in the belief that</p><p name="7e96" id="7e96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">have created for this guide, as I believe this is the optimal way of</p><p name="a8bc" id="a8bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">to sort of just zap you into place with little effort, then unfortunately this guide has not been designed for that purpose.</p><p name="650e" id="650e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">. If you love to learn, you will have a great time with this guide. If you don’t, then you’ll have a lot of difficulty with just about everything else in your life.</p><p name="ef17" id="ef17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only issue, and is something which this guide cannot provide you, is the motivation to learn. If you don’t love to learn, if you don’t have that curiosity to figure things out, then there is little this guide can offer you.</p><p name="6e47" id="6e47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though perhaps that’s a good place for you to start. To learn how you</p><p name="a907" id="a907" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There will be a few core skills which will help you tremendously in your path towards mental health. Actually, there is only one.</p><p name="c4dc" id="c4dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is, your ability to learn.</p><p name="f780" id="f780" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the largest frustrations in regards to the current landscape of mental health treatment is of the vast conflict in regards to the opinions of what depression is and how best to approach it.</p><p name="18bd" id="18bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While there are many different potential causes for this lack of consensus, I believe this is primarily a failure of solution above all else.</p><p name="33dd" id="33dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">not of</p><p name="1181" id="1181" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There seems to be a lot of conflict in regards to the</p><p name="e074" id="e074" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This mental health guide is not optimal by any stretch of the imagination. There are many more guides in my opinion, which don’t require an intimate study of how the mind produces mental illness and can produce effective and long-lasting results.</p><p name="ab2d" id="ab2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only issue is that these guides don’t work. Not because they aren’t designed to work, however because your brain won’t allow it to work.</p><p name="82c6" id="82c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, this guide is designed to work with your unwilling brain. It aims to teach the basics in a way that work with the limitations of your mental illness.</p><p name="a01b" id="a01b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe a large part of the resistance in coming to understand mental illness is in the way we use words to describe it. There is a lot of confusion as to what mental illness actually is, what it does, what it</p><p name="f155" id="f155" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think this mental health guide demonstrates a number of things that are currently lacking from other guides.</p><p name="f36f" id="f36f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you haven’t noticed, I’ve also been trying to suspend your disbelief with my words. This is usually done by design, such as writing with neutral tones, in order to instill these skills and perspectives. Some like to play the Buddhist monk, though I promise I won’t do that to you.</p><p name="8ae8" id="8ae8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The suppression is usually subtle. People will write with an air of wisdom to their words, with a conveyed calmness in their tone. Hell, I’m technically doing it right now, in a way that paints a certain picture of who I am.</p><p name="5238" id="5238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wrote this mental health guide with the knowledge that they do not work.</p><p name="1db6" id="1db6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I also wrote this mental health guide with the knowledge that most people would not know this, and would most likely pursue a mental health guide to deal with their mental health problems.</p><p name="d119" id="d119" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason they do not work is complicated, though no more complicated than your own relationship with your mental health.</p><p name="bbcb" id="bbcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">H</p></div></div></section>
