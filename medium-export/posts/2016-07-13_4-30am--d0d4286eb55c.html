Pour it like an extended regret over my dying carcass to be extracted at a future date from the resolution eating my heart out.”</p><p name="64fe" id="64fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfriendly thoughts, go away.</p><p name="5387" id="5387" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve noticed I like the cold, even as I sit on the couch in an extreme shiver of uncomfortable ineptitude, burning through the precipice of my spine with the feel-good emotions I’ve come to abhor. As I look over my shoulder I notice a lack of heater on the floor below, precisely due to my location in the living room where central heating reigns supreme.</p><p name="a618" id="a618" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given the time of day, I’m reluctant to turn it on. Besides, heat seems to be one of many key emotional triggers, haunting my inability to simply remain calm and dignified at the chalice of haste.</p><p name="ee19" id="ee19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If there’s one thing my mental health has taught me it’s that I do better in times of scarcity than I do with the platter firmly secured in my lap, deconstructed from the pink-ruby diamonds our ancestors cherished and made-clean.</p><p name="6bf8" id="6bf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s why I flourished when experimenting with cold showers; it’s as if the suffering were a kind of cleansing against my immeasurable talent to self-sabotage and belittle. On the other hand, when stuck at home in a familiar warmth, I view it as an excuse to indulge and splurge upon the things which make me sad and incapable.</p><p name="6add" id="6add" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s like an eternal tease of unlimited tenure, sucking away my ability to think whilst providing me with the power to reinforce and regulate. How charming given I’m currently wearing an East German coat which is as thick as the false-smiles worn by impoverished Soviet children, awaiting their death in a cold, unfriendly snow.</p><p name="8a67" id="8a67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some very convoluted reason I enjoy wearing my East German Coat. I mean, I never knew it was an East German Coast until I’d done some research, but I liked the inherent power in the novice epaulette buttons, like a kind of fancy party we’ve all been invited to.</p><p name="a73c" id="a73c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who knows. There was something glamorous that took my eye as I glanced into the mirror and befriended my newfound love, reflecting upon the social oppression I’d probably felt within myself. I wanted to become a man as defined by imagination, rather than reality, in a slow and gradual and gradual and gradual.</p><p name="4445" id="4445" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hell, I know it’s genuine because of the tobacco lining the inside coat reams, as fresh as 1962 can remember.</p><p name="d2e1" id="d2e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though to get back on topic, it’s always odd to be up at such times, especially when voluntary due to the stress keeping you up at night. Yet somewhere in my mind is a justification to the madness, delivering a kind of clarity and loneliness unmatched in it’s ability to make you doubt your own social cohesion. It’s like a lie that knows it’s own secret, pandering to the masses in dry textonomy.</p><p name="476e" id="476e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some reason I’ve been fixated on this polarity between wet and dry. There’s something violent, yet inextricably irreversible in the interaction between these two element. You can become instantly wet, yet it can take years to remove yourself of the guilt and shame weighing you down. Of course, then there is the ocean… as wet as it’ll always be.</p><p name="84d0" id="84d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We enjoy the words because they keep us warm. Blah. Blah.</p><p name="1b9f" id="1b9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">UNIX time.</p></div></div></section>
