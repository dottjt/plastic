In this post I want to focus on the idea of narrative and what I’ve learnt from it over the past couple of weeks making videos.

This is perfectly fine as I’m only just starting out, however I could tell there was something intrinsically missing from the subtle construction of magic I attempt to recreate each week.</p><p name="8128" id="8128" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I loved about my second video was the spontaneity of the humour. While it was raw, it was also coherent and everything flowed beautifully in-spite of the apparent randomness of my words. Each and every joke felt thoughtful (hardly) and in-sync with the common theme of the video.</p><p name="b1f7" id="b1f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the proceeding videos that followed however, everything felt a tad disjointed. Though there was humour, it was not heartfelt. In many ways, instead of conveying intelligent introspection, it felt like as if you were watching a mad man shout into a camera without any regard to message.</p><p name="3348" id="3348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It all felt so forced and contrived; something which I think I now understand and would like to share with you.</p><p name="ef0a" id="ef0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, it begs to understand that my videos are delivered in the form of a monologue. As monologues are generally static by nature, this poses all the obvious issues of boredom and uneventfulness that can be demonstrated by watching wet-paint dry.</p><p name="d772" id="d772" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even if you did manage to write one of the most witty, fast-paced, snappy scripts ever devised by man, without sufficient videography (camera changes, ambience etc.), your video will just look like an ordinary person talking into a camera, rather than a video alive with ideas.</p><p name="4943" id="4943" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Curse you unchanging backdrop!</p><p name="5570" id="5570" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, in my silly mind, I confused this lack of videography with the false idea that my videos weren’t raunchy enough; that if I acted like an even bigger dickhead, that I would be able to better capture people’s attention.</p><p name="e614" id="e614" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was wrong.</p><p name="df69" id="df69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose that’s the one of the limitations of approaching video from the mindset of a writer: We instead tend to focus on the script and content, rather than on more essential elements of videography like the editing and composition. Who knows, it could just be that I’m a terrible actor (and I am).</p><p name="fc85" id="fc85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I always did want to create something that was outrageous; something so incredibly wrong, so incredibly brash, that it not only challenged our notions of society, however completely disregarded them as something meaningless.</p><p name="7cc6" id="7cc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I suppose the idea behind my videos is to make people feel comfortable with the intelligent, seemingly sane person behind the character, while inherently detached from insane things the character behind the person is saying. In essence, to encourage critical thought.</p></div></div></section><section name="a649" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="1229" id="1229" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">So with the premise laid out, here’s what I actually learnt about making videos over the past couple of weeks.</p><blockquote name="e7dc" id="e7dc" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">There is a very real difference between the idea of a theme and a coherent narrative.</blockquote><p name="9504" id="9504" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgpNq00pJyY" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgpNq00pJyY" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My third video</a>, entitled 21ST CENTURY PROBLEMS more-or-less has no coherent narrative (at least one that was apparent), however it did contain a very general theme which I managed to confuse as narrative.</p><p name="50af" id="50af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I thought that by making a heap of jokes around a central theme (in this case, the current dysfunction of the 21st century), that I could somehow give meaning to my rant. Yet as I discovered, themes are not what drive stories forward. Instead, narratives drive stories forward.</p><p name="44c3" id="44c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Themes don’t have beginnings, middles and ends. Themes don’t have purpose or motivation in convincing the viewer to believe. Themes don’t hold us together.</p><p name="4fcc" id="4fcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Narratives do.</p><p name="a800" id="a800" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While themes have drawing power, narratives have staying power, which is what makes videos enjoyable to watch, rather than a confusing pile of vermilion mess.</p><p name="f0fd" id="f0fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps more importantly, narratives have the power to make humour seem intentional, rather than something tacked together or the sake of producing a reaction.</p><p name="2608" id="2608" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is another thing I’ve noticed being a writer creating videos. Often when I write, I think about how my words are going to make people feel. Yet when you’re creating video, it’s not your words that affect how people feel: It’s the entire construction of the video that does. In a way, it’s a whole new different way of looking at things.</p><p name="d883" id="d883" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe this is why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ExuxDEXWgQ" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ExuxDEXWgQ" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MLG videos</a> get it right. It’s an entire composition of silly, but it’s held so tightly together by so many different aspects of videography, that it gets it right no matter how batshit the whole thing is.</p><p name="5a4d" id="5a4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, when you’re delivering fast-paced humour; humour that is often contentious for the sake of being striking, you really need to make sure that your audience is interpreting your jokes on the same level of understanding that you are.</p><p name="7a9c" id="7a9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is because when concepts are striking, they can be interpreted in many different ways and when your content is particularly offensive, it is imperative that you make sure that it is delivered in a way that is obviously humourous, so to suspend their disbelief.</p><p name="6193" id="6193" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is best done with proper videography, which brings me to my second point.</p><blockquote name="19ef" id="19ef" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Narrative is not a replacement for substance and substance is so much more than footage.</blockquote><p name="4448" id="4448" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">In contrast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3StVdOPaxZQ" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3StVdOPaxZQ" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my fourth video</a>, entitled EVERYONE’S FIRST JOB INTERVIEW was an attempt to try and creative a tight, coherent narrative; one that was believable and sane (though inevitable, my terrible acting had no saviours in this department). It tried to create substance by being believable (though in the end, it tried a little too hard and failed).</p><p name="1cac" id="1cac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Substance can mean many different things to different people, however I would like to state that it is so much more than what you see on the screen.</p><p name="bb14" id="bb14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Substance is created from the music we use in our videos. It is created from the editing and the pauses in-between scenes. Substance is not just the footage you see on screen; the character waving his arms about like a maniac, it is the holistic perception of video to the viewer.</p><p name="598a" id="598a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Substance not only emphasises the importance of creativity in the script, however the entire approach we have towards film. Using the wrong kind of music for example, detracts substance — again, the perception of the video to the view.</p><p name="1e65" id="1e65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">One aspect I really liked about EVERYONE’S FIRST JOB INTERVIEW was near the end of the video where I tackled the camera down to the ground. It created an element of surrealness to the whole thing and it’s small aspects like these which emphasise how videos can be engaging on a personal level and create substance.</p></div></div></section><section name="12e5" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="b4c4" id="b4c4" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">With all this said, I feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TceF9bR4hlc" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TceF9bR4hlc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my fifth and latest video</a>, HOT DATE WITH A SYRIAN REFUGEE, really does capture all these elements very well.</p><figure name="ca93" id="ca93" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Offensive, really doesn’t quite cut it.</figcaption></figure><p name="be19" id="be19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I added contrasting footage to break the video up, the video makes use of a great deal of comedic editing which I haven’t tried before and the added use of music in key areas has really has allowed me to emphasise the silliness of some my jokes.</p><p name="8762" id="8762" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it’s one thing I’ve realised, it’s that progress is gradual and that there’s no reason to feel bad if things don’t work out the first few times. From what I’ve discoverd, talent is just a matter of practice and the more I make videos, the more I learn about making videos and that’s really all there is to it.</p><p name="dd87" id="dd87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In later posts, it would be interesting to talk about the psychology of making these videos, because I remember that’s what truly crushed me the first time I attempted stardom.</p></div></div></section>
