I really hate how nothing works. It’s like having an invisible hand holding you back, telling you not to play with the other children. “The children are hurtful,” the teacher says, as you watch them frolic in joyful glee, throwing hugs and kisses in a mosh pit full of phallic indecency.</p><p name="97ac" id="97ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So instead, I get a stick with my name on it; a charred reminder that my material possessions serve only as a coping mechanism from the insanity and comfort my growing body requires. “I think your new friend likes you,” she says, as the stick breaks and crumbles into your lonely hands. “Oh, don’t worry,” she says, handing you another stick.</p><p name="28ac" id="28ac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“This one has my name on it. The name of your past.”</p><p name="ab72" id="ab72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At times I feel as if I have to give myself permission to breathe. It’s a sad, though necessary feeling, providing me with the sustenance to remain adult in tough situations, as I seek what little enlightenment I have in the worrying vision clouding my thoughts. I know it’s not a real kind of esplanade into our predisposed foray, however it’s charming to know that I’m still alive, sucking down on the posterior for the gleaming cameras above.</p><p name="79ad" id="79ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Always watching, always mimicking. Of course, I know the premise merely serves as a ruse for my own pleasure; a little fuck-buddy I keep pent up in a cage within the jungle of my own mind, ready for the motions that are written so clearly on the box. “Two batteries, both speaking a different language. Gee, who’d thunk it?”</p><p name="31c1" id="31c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you must know, it’s 9:33AM and I’m currently sitting at the City Library, pretending to be study to qualify as the ultimate nerd. Actually, I WAS studying code, until I realised how pointlessly difficult the whole charade was, which is why I’m back to doing what I love best: needlessly raping the logic in my brain to produce the kind of pretentious bullshit we all love at price no one can afford.</p><p name="2184" id="2184" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, to be honest, I think I was having a bit of a mental breakdown, which is why I thought I might be useful to capitalise upon the opportunity to create some art and demonstrate to the world that you can still be hopelessly fabulous, even if your feelings are attacking you from all angles.</p><p name="8a47" id="8a47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Reade is back baby.</p><p name="b189" id="b189" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">PS: Though really, I just hate jQuery because despite its utility, is another bloated piece of crap I want to keep away from my workflow. Burn it, then chuck it. If you can’t chuck it, then burn it some more.</p></div></div></section>
