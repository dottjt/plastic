The warden has been shot and he’s bleeeeeeeding. Okay, the warden is fine, however my mind isn’t quite so forgiving of the promises it makes to itself on a daily basis.</p><p name="c063" id="c063" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, I think I know why I suffer from depression.</p><p name="5c6c" id="5c6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To myself and many others, depression is much more than just being sad. Sadness is only one small aspect of what makes depression tick as part of the living, breathing world our minds inhabit. </p><p name="599a" id="599a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a terrifying way, depression serves as an escape from reality. Through our depression we experience this dark, exciting place where stories and narratives are brought to life and more crucially; are believed with utter sincerity. </p><p name="cbf9" id="cbf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, many of us were brought up as cynics in life. </p><p name="dcd2" id="dcd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We knew Santa was bullshit. We could tell there was something wrong with that seemingly talking puppet with a hand shoved up it’s ass. The evidence was clear, though our minds couldn’t quite hack it. </p><p name="9ea4" id="9ea4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet in a sick, twisted moment of fate, depression arose as a way to disprove our pessimism. Depression brought us a form of belief which cynicism could not disprove. It was a perfect answer to our imperfect thoughts. </p><p name="d782" id="d782" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the one hand, convincing yourself that god exists is difficult when you’re conscious aware of impossibility. </p><p name="381b" id="381b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However in a state of depression and disillusionment, belief in any entity becomes as easy as drinking water, especially for a bunch of cynicism find it very difficult to believe.</p><p name="5e29" id="5e29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depression allows you believe your own cynicism and as a tool for self-mastery, is an exclamation of why the two go hand in hand.</p><p name="c37f" id="c37f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the depressed, it was never about the destruction, self-harm or culminated hatred that you had for yourself. Those aspects of your personality were always secondary to the crux keeping you clean.</p><p name="8920" id="8920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s about the belief that resided in your mind; that you deserved your fate and were worthy of it. Entirely irreplaceable of anything else.</p><p name="d479" id="d479" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Call it a form of masochism. Fair enough.</p><p name="d0c9" id="d0c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However for the cynics of this world, depression is a form of story telling, adventure and excitement.</p><p name="8647" id="8647" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Belief allows you to escape.</p><p name="24cf" id="24cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It allows you to disbelieve the world around you that is seemingly grey in it’s reality. </p><p name="83ae" id="83ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet without belief, without my depression, I am just another human being, drifting in and out of their daily duties with a mind to inhabit or own. </p><p name="97c6" id="97c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Human explorers, travelling thousands of miles into sea, risking their entire lives, would not have left if they did not believe they would not find land. </p><p name="9588" id="9588" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet they were also willing to accept that the risk was theirs and that there was a high chance of failure. </p><p name="e6de" id="e6de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what kept them going? </p><p name="3c2c" id="3c2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hope kept them going, because of the belief that they would find land.</p><p name="9a31" id="9a31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What many people do not realise is that depression serves as a form of hope for those afraid of hope itself.</p><p name="d030" id="d030" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you do not have hope, you have vulnerability and that leads directly to something worse than depression: Unadulterated chaos. </p><p name="3bbd" id="3bbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You become impressionable to your surroundings. </p><p name="8356" id="8356" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You allow the depression to suck you in and dissolve you like a wet marshmellow in the fire, screaming and scaring until the feint yellow embers drift away with your purpose. </p><p name="36c9" id="36c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like a viper with sharp fangs; a danger to all that perceive you.</p><p name="ae42" id="ae42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all need something to believe and latch onto, and in a world so visceral and real, hopelessness often leaves us no choice.</p><p name="0579" id="0579" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is why nothing will compare to the feeling of depression.</p><p name="79dd" id="79dd" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="a945" id="a945" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
