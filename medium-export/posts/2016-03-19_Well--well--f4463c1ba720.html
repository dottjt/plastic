A miserable day to reflect my equally miserable mood. I certainly threw in the towel this morning when I awoke at 7am to the thunderous roar of rain and wind, which quite willingly accompanied me from my immediate exit from these safe and dark corridors, to a lonely bus stop which never once tried to pretend that it was anything more than a refugee for the hungry and weak.</p><p name="10ae" id="10ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nothing went right. Neither in the physical world, nor in my head, and that’s okay. I’ve more-or-less been teetering on the verge of tears all day, and as I stand here, forced to swallow my pride and self-worth by the mouthful, I taste nothing but the dry haste which escapes my sensibilities, for no other reason, than because a “fuck-me”. Thank you, non-believer.</p><p name="6181" id="6181" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who cares about that dickhead crying on the bus, wiping his runny snot onto his journey-man bag. I tell ya what, it was more humane than wiping it on the empty seat next to me, which I did on one occasion, when the snot was too much to handle.</p><p name="44ca" id="44ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would be inaccurate for me to describe guilt as a feeling of humility, however a large portion of the immediate fun of depression comes down to just sitting there, almost reliably, to realise there is absolutely nothing you can do but feel your own vulnerability taunt you. Not only do you have no place in your own mind, however it feels as if you are being judged and completely despised by the world around you, like a kind of virus everyone is beginning to fear.</p><p name="cea9" id="cea9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who knows, I probably deserve what I feel. So kill me. Just kill me right now and stop complaining about how terrible I am. Contrary to popular belief, people really do try their hardest to change, even if they may be destroying every single collaterally acceptable notion in their path. Of course, perception is the game that fucks you most. Please stop hitting my reflection in the mirror. I need it to see properly, and your disruption is just rude.</p><p name="5d36" id="5d36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Good humility has no direction, which is why I decided it would be best if I sat there and just took it like a good, fucking citizen. You know, love thy democracy, because it sure as hell has no capacity to love you back.</p><p name="7b40" id="7b40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understand that your pain derives from a small part of the large wound I have exposed to you, which I promise inflicts me greater. I may be the worst person in the world, but my worst, is not an accurate reflection of who I am as a human being. Please don’t blame me for my wound. No one wants to be wounded, let alone a victim to their own insanity.</p><p name="361e" id="361e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though my wound is not necessarily a bad thing. Not because I win this contest of being “the most fucked up”, but because when you experience such pain, it forces you to reconsider yourself and your actions. It forces you to change in such a way that may be difficult, but clearly willing in its path. Even though my wound has opened, I feel like I am doing the right thing by letting it air first, before directly patching it and allowing it to heal.</p><p name="e812" id="e812" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to forgive myself and others, because I feel that’s the only true way to overcome my misery. It’s the most difficult approach one can take, but it’s better than holding onto to any kind of intense or negative emotion, which clearly does not serve towards developing love within my own life.</p><p name="e2f7" id="e2f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a really interesting thing I read about forgiveness today, taken from <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-forgive-someone-and-move-on" data-href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-forgive-someone-and-move-on" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Quora</a>:</p><blockquote name="d538" id="d538" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Forgiveness</strong> is done for <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">our</em> own sake. I repeat — for <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">our sake only</em>. It is unburdening ourselves of the anger and vengeful feelings we are carrying within. Stopping to punish ourselves for somebody else’s fault. Saying “I have decided to stop holding on these negative feelings — which hurt nobody but me”. To let go. It’s granting permission to the wound to heal. So that your heart can ‘un-harden’, become soft again, regain its vulnerability and hence, move on. After all, intimacy is being ready to be vulnerable.</blockquote><blockquote name="bd50" id="bd50" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Reconciliation</strong> is done for <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">their</em> sake. Giving them another chance. Getting back together. Trusting them again. Its a choice — based on our comfort and capability. We are ready to be vulnerable, but not in front of <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">this</em> person maybe.</blockquote><p name="78ee" id="78ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">You see, you can try and fight it by making up some kind of narrative that you’re better or more a victim, or whatever. Instead of letting go, you place all your faith in your anger and sadness, which you use to try and conquer your own emotions, as if you’re some kind of demi-god with an infallible opinion. However, in the end, you merely allow yourself to be conquered and it’s a cock-block, if I ever recognised one.</p><p name="2401" id="2401" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps I know from experience that it’s futile to try and fight yourself. Certainly, there are situations where it cannot be helped. Often, when the person is right in front of you, you just react. You lose your capacity to think, and you allow the charade to play out, as it all breaks down, shouting helplessly at your apparent aggressor, who wants nothing more than for you to just leave them alone. Maybe even become friends again, who knows.</p><p name="8818" id="8818" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only issue is that you merely end up in the same sanctuary of frustration you were a few weeks later. So unless if you’re willing to continue upholding this entirely fabricated battle in your mind, which will not only consume you, but tear you apart, then the next best thing is to just sit there, take it, and stop complaining.</p><p name="b36e" id="b36e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Observe. Observe intensely. Don’t say anything. Don’t react. Calm down. Become comfortable with yourself. Understand there is nothing wrong with you, nothing to fear. Let go of your self-image, your self-worth. None of it is real. Let go of your self-perception of others. They are just people too, no special, no more significant than yourself. Throw all those medals away, because you won’t need them in this exercise.</p><p name="e2c7" id="e2c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All that pride, false hope and delusion; ignored and tainted. I’m starting from scratch and unfortunately, that means succumbing to the stereotype that has been branded of me, a hack, a loser and a person who is haphazardly toxic.</p><p name="0abf" id="0abf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I know I’m not those things, but I also know that accepting these facts is a lot more difficult than trying to change the descriptions behind them. I don’t want to meddle in the world of description, because I know that it is not real. They are just the thoughts and perceptions of others, which I have allowed to invade inside me. Yes, I’m not perfect, however if it’s one thing I’m willing to admit, it’s that I have the courage to expose myself to become something resembling the bright and mighty cousin of acceptance.</p><p name="4c00" id="4c00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess I won’t talk about all that was wrong with today. Missing my first bus. The rain that was pissing down, soaking me in the worst possible way. My new shoes, which were significantly cutting into my heels. The lunch order that was the complete opposite to what I actually ordered. Trying to keep a cool face at work, when really, I was ready to make a break for it and hold the entire building ransom. Waiting more than 30 minutes for my bus back home, because the traffic was that bad.</p><p name="3bb1" id="3bb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh wait, I just did.</p><p name="4a76" id="4a76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hate myself and currently, living is like this unbearable roller coaster which never seems to end. Gee, I don’t fucking know. I don’t really know what to say as a puppet without original thought. I just do what I’m told and I guess that’s perfectly adequate.</p><p name="5d33" id="5d33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know I’ll get better. Maybe not today. Probably not tomorrow, however time is my friend and my gosh, someone please remind me how addictive pornography is again, because it has me hooked left, right and sinker.</p><p name="3f9d" id="3f9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Feed me.</p></div></div></section>
