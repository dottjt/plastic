Though firstly, some context. </p><p name="a70e" id="a70e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t usually drink an excessive amount of alcohol, at least in season. In fact, I’d recently taken a three month break from drinking, as I believe it was an impact on my mental health. However, I was bored and lonely on a Friday night, and with my housemate the only human contact I’d had all day, decided to splurge on the liquor he routinely would bring home with him. </p><p name="26e7" id="26e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tanqueray. The world’s finest gin. It’s appropriately sweet without wanting to choke you down and as someone who likes to drink straight, is a viable prospect for my dying taste buds. He planted down the bottle like a right of passage on the wooden centrepiece, claiming our friendship and demise in one. </p><p name="598d" id="598d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though really, it was subtle. </p><p name="08c4" id="08c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d already had a few ciders to myself, which would set the tone of the night to come.

As you can tell, I’m Mark. His flatmate Jeremy, a bisexual party-prone maniac, is what keeps Mark’s life fun and interesting, a perfect duo for the “rager” that ensues. </p><p name="3f7b" id="3f7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With half a bottle of gin in my liver, I was feeling quite fine. In fact, it was like I wasn’t drunk at all. Then something happened. Within five minutes I went from “We could probably have sex” to being completely knocked out </p><p name="bc5c" id="bc5c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="5980" id="5980" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="21a7" id="21a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">There I was, hitting my head in shame.
