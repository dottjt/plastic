My mind more-or-less breaks down into an incomprehensible mess in their presence, as I try not to stare at the more striking features of their body. I just look like an even bigger idiot trying to hide it.</p><p name="d0c8" id="d0c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Focusing on the finer details, movies almost invariably make me cry. I get really emotional attached very easily. Scary movies don’t particularly affect me. It’s almost TOO obvious that it’s supposed to be scary.</p><p name="94a9" id="94a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose that exposes the superstition of my mind. I’m incredibly susceptible to things like romance, because I like to entertain this idea in my mind that there is something magical floating about that we can’t quite describe.</p><p name="500f" id="500f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I worry that a stranger will one day approach me and ask me to run away and leave everything behind. I doubt I would do it, though who knows. Sometimes life just flips on itself.</p><p name="62ea" id="62ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humans want to be sold hope. We want to be sold on the idea that there is something worth living for, which is why we fall trap to scams and affairs.</p><p name="9292" id="9292" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am incredibly impressionable in this sense. I like the idea of the victim complex, as well as the hero.</p><p name="ebb7" id="ebb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At my core however, my impressionability runs deep. I used to take a lot of acid not too long ago, as a way of expercieng pure impressionability.</p><p name="f15c" id="f15c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would imagine my body being crushed and turned into </p><p name="598f" id="598f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I just loved the possibilty that it brought. </p><p name="01f2" id="01f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it’s one weakness I have a person, it’s that I’m incredibly impressionable.</p><p name="2a4f" id="2a4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would probably explain why I lend myself towards victim mindsets and in particularly, all that acid I took long ago.</p><p name="c87a" id="c87a" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
