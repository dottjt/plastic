(edit)</h3><p name="8bb6" id="8bb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m currently experiencing one of those, you know, superficial moments of serenity, also known as pride. </p><p name="7179" id="7179" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pride is a feeling of bursting familiarity; a shocking revelation into your own self-confidence, as if to suggest a kind of tappered loveliness in the mental agony and self-criticise we ritualise on a daily basis, born from the hysteria and placid alimony we have shoved down our throats. </p><p name="d603" id="d603" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a moment that lingers in ours thoughts as the next great invention, in a cultural destruction of last week’s old food which remains stale like microwaved tortellini, sitting in a glass bain-marie last cleaned since the Roman Empire. All that dripping insolence, gathered into a curdled heave of emulsified lactose and cunning desperation. </p><p name="1d95" id="1d95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe it’s because I’ve been seeing myself in action, throwing away words in a violent dishonesty that would make any child gleam. If it helps to understand what it means to have pride, perhaps it might make sense to fall back on a different time in my past to truly extrapolate the oozing coming from my mind. </p><p name="24e9" id="24e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I was a young child, I was forced to do a lot of different things, one of them being music. I was one of those half-assed musical prodigies, who was good enough to impress the judges, though was clearly inadequate to lead any kind of resistance into </p><p name="a55f" id="a55f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like a lot of the things I was taught as a child, I was never very good at most of them, and furthermore, I wouldn’t become good at a small fraction of them until well after childhood. Of course, as someone who also attended a selective entry high school of cheap academics and flailing social personalities, was more often exposed to those who were excellent at what they did, rather than those like me, who were never taught what it meant to be proficient. </p><p name="b7e9" id="b7e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fortunately for me, the next best thing I had was music. It was a talent that the other kids could say: “Yeah, I think I was sort of impressed, at least to a point that I know absolutely nothing about the saxophone to want to be awed. Not quite YouTube viral quality, but something to ponder until lunchtime,” as I walked off the stage in an incredibly awkward Year 10 recital. </p><p name="b902" id="b902" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet pride isn’t about being good. It’s about being better and in a setting completely dominated by those who were much, much better than me, cultivated a kind of guilt and shame in me as something incapable. One of the big things about playing music is being able to play solos and simply improvise like a chirpity-chrip bird, calling out for the surrounding beauty to come out and play. </p><p name="b384" id="b384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is to great shame for me to say that I was incapable of playing solos or improvising to any capacity, which meant even as lead saxophone, relied on another saxophonist to play those quirky solos for me. </p><p name="0b7c" id="0b7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In any case, my natural response was to dismiss and accept my inability to meet the challenge. It’s like a lie you tell yourself everyday to acquain </p><p name="2469" id="2469" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most importantly, it’s an experience that teaches you not to value pride, as it teaches you that you are not worthy of pride, as someone completely undeserving of the world around you. It is a great insecurity that I’m sure many people can relate to.</p><p name="29d7" id="29d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So why am I feeling pride, exactly? </p><p name="3250" id="3250" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am feeling pride because in a rare moment of delusion, I can safely classify and identify myself as an amazing writer. I was writing a piece earlier and it made me realise how good I am as a writer. Specifically, my ability to use words in the sense of poetry, rather than from a point of view of meaning, whilst actually enhancing meaning in the process.</p><p name="aea0" id="aea0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In other words, I am able to do with words what I could never do with music: improvise and solo to a high degree of a disbelief. The pride comes when you manage even to fool yourself; something which conjures a magical sense of heightened euphoria in your own place here on earth. </p></div></div></section>
