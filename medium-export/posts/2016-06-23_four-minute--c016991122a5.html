Charm and flutter collaborating with a calculated finesse, surrounding and roaring into a grand crescendo. Estate fluoresca, established circa 1893.</p><p name="e6ac" id="e6ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is that I’m bottled with anxiety. My heart is pounding and my head is waiving. There’s a fear that sings with confidence, echoing loudly with an immaculate forte. It’s thirty minutes until I begin my interview and I already feel queazy. I mean, I was completely confident with all my other interviews, however this time is a little different. We must strike at the heart of the beast.</p><p name="ae3c" id="ae3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m currently at the base of a luxurious skyscraper, awing at the vivid ambience drawing me in. The fading chatter preoccupies a hollow space, consuming luxury as if glamour were more important than oxygen. The complete alistair of gargantuan white columns reflects upon the matte gloss of the lower marble, impenetrable and stout; impressive without words.</p><p name="963a" id="963a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All the while, my heart is crumbling.</p><p name="29bf" id="29bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My lungs feel like a cheap disposable plastic and my vision is slowly fading into a pit of blue men in sharp attire. I assume the couch I’m currently sitting on is real leather. I’d lick it to be sure, however I wouldn’t dare come across as someone disingenuous in such unlikely circumstances.</p><p name="6236" id="6236" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here I am.</p><p name="6355" id="6355" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve taken the elevator and I’m currently sitting in the guest lobby of an “undisclosed company”. Well, of course I know what the company is, I’m just not inclined to tell you. I’m sure they wouldn’t appreciate it as well, considering the untraditional arrangement I’ve been provided.</p><p name="8d5c" id="8d5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The obligatory thing to do whilst standing a few hundreds metres in the air is to stare out onto the street and observe the ants below. Of course, the premise eventually looses it’s novelty, to which you must return to the terribly oblong and awkwardly shaped couch awaiting your discomfort. This one is a convex, because unfortunately, reality. While it would be perfect to curl up upon for a Saturday night movie with a significant other, remains a kind of burden as you try and lean as far back as possible without completely destroying your spine.</p><p name="6302" id="6302" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s four minutes to go.</p><p name="1bed" id="1bed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not okay. I’m going to die. I think I see someone getting ready in the meeting room. It doesn’t feel safe in here. I feel like fish food. When are they going to ask me to run out into no man’s land? I’m sure death would be less complicated than the torment I’m currently experiencing.</p><p name="22a9" id="22a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two minutes.</p><p name="75e8" id="75e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m sorry god. I’m sorry I killed that small child. Help. Help. Help. I don’t like it. It’s worse than waiting for a rollercoaster. Are you kidding me! It’s still at two minutes!?</p><p name="574a" id="574a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Okay, one minute to go. I think I see him coming.</p><p name="1fc2" id="1fc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s over.</p><p name="7de8" id="7de8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I smashed it, as I usually do.</p></div></div></section>
