The paradox is that I care about the wrong things. I care about being a voice heard in the wind, I care about … maybe writing is a dead skill. Maybe that’s the problem, my ability only to view it as a skill, as a tool, rather than anything significant or pretty.</p><p name="bf4b" id="bf4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t like it. Simple is the emotion that keeps you alive. Simple is the self-expression that eats you until complete</p><p name="d43e" id="d43e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hello diary today. I can tell you are tired. Your mind makes no sense. A spaghetti sandwich, eating butter with the parade. I would say that it’s some mild form of sleep deprivation.</p><p name="fae6" id="fae6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, I’ve only noticed that I feel comfortable expressing myself… to myself. It’s like, I try and explain things to other people and they just feel like conceptual let downs, praying towards the direction of the sun. I mean, sunlight, obviously, is amazing, however let’s look at me for a second. I want you to look into my eyes and notice my existence. Yes. It feels good and then I perish, down into the shadows.</p><p name="a550" id="a550" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I’m just weak. It’s obvious that I’m deficient at everything I do, but I feel as if my dreams have taken a different direction in life. Hell, life is just hard and that’s something I have to accept. I have to accept that I’ll probably be destroyed if I ever try, however with a few lovely connections, I’m sure fortune will come towards hell, allowing me to propogate and tenure.</p><p name="317a" id="317a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is nothing more to express in the wallow. When I think about it, I have always used works to deconstruct, rather than construct. Words are a tool for analyzing, rather than creation and I feel that’s where they shine. However after years of deconstruction, it has come to my attention that there is little else in my mind to explore. The confusion, the hatred, the depression — can only provide so much consolidation for the mind.</p><p name="e671" id="e671" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I need to learn to relax. That’s the hardest thing, convincing myself that I should just let go and retire. There never feels like a good time to retire, to give up, to die, yet that seems like the only possible option within these times. To give up on yourself and implode. Instead, you end up wrestling with your own invisible shell, pretending that everything will be okay, if only you stop pretending and start facing reality with a strong face.</p><p name="e0e6" id="e0e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s simply no work to do, which is why it’s important to create your own. So I guess, in that sense, I will write and write and write until I can be convinced that something dire will happen and turn me sour. Yes, sour.</p><p name="e726" id="e726" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not entirely sure what interests me anymore. Perhaps not even as a bad thing, just as a topic of curiosity. Part of the issue is that there is no longer any reward in being an expert in anything any more. There are already thousands upon thousands of experts who already know everything there is about the world. Maybe it’s okay to be unknown. Though to be afraid? Not particularly. In fact, I can work on my mental health. There you go.</p><p name="bffc" id="bffc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">of%20ba������</p><p name="0b6e" id="0b6e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
