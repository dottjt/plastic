University takes around three years. Internships and entry level jobs another three on top of that. </p><p name="4921" id="4921" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not to mention, we actually have no idea what we’re doing, nor whether we actually want to become journalists, doctors or lawyers and yet are forced into these dreams as if destiny were a fatal expectation.</p><p name="7354" id="7354" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s also assuming that someone even bothers to look at our resume, which for the hunderds of applicants out there for the one job, is unlikely for many of us. </p><p name="0e10" id="0e10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet in my infinite confusion, I decided to persevere.</p><p name="bcd1" id="bcd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of it was due to foolishness in believing that it is okay to have dreams. The other part was vaguely understanding that anything else is mere short-sightedness, as much as I’m lead to believe otherwise. </p><p name="ad83" id="ad83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t really have any idea what I wanted to do. No one does, however I decided to follow my heart and somehow, everything has just fallen into place.</p><p name="e66b" id="e66b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have a full-time job in PR and Communications where I get to travel the country and writing articles all day. I interview people from within high levels of government and industry (which isn’t nearly as amazing or glamourous as it sounds).</p><p name="7521" id="7521" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My educaiton actually paid off, and while it was a difficult position to get into, I’ve realised is not what I want to do as a career. </p><p name="ae52" id="ae52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was at a conference recently and I was setting up tables when something struck me. </p><p name="d73f" id="d73f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not so much an epiphany, so much as a feeling of gratitude that had been lacking in my self-perception of who I was.</p><p name="6d83" id="6d83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In that moment, I felt grateful to have passion in my life.</p><p name="ff52" id="ff52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It wasn’t the news podcast take took me three hours to produce each morning, the 5+ years spent in community radio, the YouTube channel that I dedicated my life towards, the blogs and writings that I had expressed my soul into.</p><p name="d190" id="d190" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was my passion for life and these things that got me to where I am today and it is a gift and a blessing that I realise, many people do not have.</p><p name="c9b8" id="c9b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is the reason why mean people stop pursing their careers. It is the reason why people stagnate: because their dreams do not have passion. </p><p name="f438" id="f438" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of this slight epiphany came down to the fact that I don’t want to work PR or Communications at all. </p><p name="2491" id="2491" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">, I had a YouTube channel, I volunteered in a radio station for the blind for three years, I did a whole number of things that almost seems kaput today.</p><p name="abc1" id="abc1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="7134" id="7134" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="64a3" id="64a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not because of the job or the career progression, but for the raging passion that I feel inside me, amongst the dreams that carry me in my sleep.</p><p name="270d" id="270d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Each and every day, I study computer science </p><p name="e0e1" id="e0e1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="9e22" id="9e22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m grateful to be a in a position without privilege, that drives me towards hard work and effort.
