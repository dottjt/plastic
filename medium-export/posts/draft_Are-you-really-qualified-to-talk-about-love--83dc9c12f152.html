While we don’t quite realise it, nearly all our experiences in life revolve around this mysterious drug, wrapped so tightly in pseudo-expression that we can never quite see it for what it is.</p><p name="8e3c" id="8e3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a child love was simple. As an adult, love is no more complicated, however it’s like we’ve all been triggered by a serious case of ADHD so bad that we can barely focus on what’s important in our lives.</p><p name="14f2" id="14f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In part, love is what compels us to write and express. In our attempt to sound glamourous, we attempt to unravel the forces which make our brain tick and yet due to the pressures of society, we focus our attention so fiercely on things like money, fame and success that we don’t even take notice to the element holding us together.</p><p name="9f92" id="9f92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Love is a topic most of us seem blind to and arguably, it is something we should write more about. In my few months of being on Medium, there’s always an angle of tragedy, life hacks and gender issues; yet very rarely is there an expose on love.</p><p name="eb94" id="eb94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the issue is that we don’t bother to understand ourselves through love. Rather, we try and understand ourselves through tragedy, regret, hatred, guilt and anxiety. In fact, we have created a disturbing culture in society where we have come to believe that love is something which is learnt by not loving.</p><p name="ab0d" id="ab0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Being physically threatened by your partner now makes you qualified to talk about love and even worse yet, we constitute bad relationship experiences with relational expertise. Having a series of terrible dates and tinder one-offs now gives you authority over what not only what dating is, but will become.</p><p name="4e8e" id="4e8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue is that we are slowly moulding our ideas of love into something it is not, creating a mis-representation of what these things are. Not only is it misleading, however it is a level of insecurity that is destructive, rather than instinctive.</p><p name="5b6b" id="5b6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What can I say. Sex and violence sells and writers are the biggest culprits. No one wants to read about your happy family marriage, because apparently that’s something which is non-unique, non-appraised and entirely worthless to the human race.</p><p name="afd7" id="afd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The irony of it all is that there isn’t a single article on marriage, yet every second article is about consent, prostitution and</p><p name="bfb5" id="bfb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s like we’re so stuck on defining our problems, rather than focusing on the big picture of what it’s all about.</p><p name="a3de" id="a3de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is an unhealthy attitude, not only because it’s not true, however because it is a result of our insecurities, rather than as part of a truthful interaction with ourselves.</p><p name="0b31" id="0b31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We equate irrational and so-called “unique” experiences as being more valuable than those which we percieve as “common” and it was completely</p><p name="f6bc" id="f6bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your experience as a prostitute, while sexual and intimate by nature, has nothing to do with love, and yet these are the kind of people we turn to for our advice. Sex sells on many different levels, however why do we go to such extremes just to try and understand ourselves? Sex and love are two completely different concepts that exist on thier own and yet the two have become so entwined it’s like we cannot live without one or the other.</p><p name="83e9" id="83e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem here isn’t necessarily the writing and certainly, we are all completely impressionable on different levels in our own way. Certainly I am entirely impressionable and that is my own flaw to speak of. However I am not the only one, and there wouldn’t be such a demand for this literature if that were the case.</p><p name="679d" id="679d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, it is a message to writers who do write about their experiences with love, sex, dating and relationships. There is nothing wrong with what you are doing, however undesrtand that there are people who do get the wrong impression.</p><p name="ca86" id="ca86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To people like me, don’t take other people’s experiences so personally. There is nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to feel worthless about, simply because you are not some kind of sex god. This is not a normal representation of society and it shouldn’t be.</p><p name="8054" id="8054" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understand that those who write about love and relationships are confused. They are not experts. In fact, they are experts at things that are far from those beautiful qualities and yet that’s the best society can do, because the jaded ones are the only people insane enough to truly question the motives behind what makes us tick.</p><p name="ca2e" id="ca2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that’s okay.</p><p name="d57a" id="d57a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re all confused and that’s why we’re here. On the one hand, another person’s perspective is a unique thing to witness. We all have our own interpretations of reality from the tragedy and triumph that emanates from our lives, and it is through these experiences that we learn.</p><p name="893e" id="893e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However what exactly is it that we’re trying to learn? What could you possibly hope to learn about having a sustainable, fulfiling relationship with another person from a bunch of stories about sexual assault?</p><p name="ad89" id="ad89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, you should be asking yourself why you’re reading these articles in the first place. Is it because you’re addicted to the sex and violence that come with these literary pleasures? Are you interested in learning about another person’s experiences? Is it a deep insecurity you have inside of you?</p><p name="cab9" id="cab9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For many people it’s a fine-line and certainly, it’s a line that I believe cannot be understated under any regard.</p><p name="2c3c" id="2c3c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b09f" id="b09f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re</p><p name="e161" id="e161" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the issue is expectation.</p><p name="016d" id="016d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="67b8" id="67b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Writing is raw</p><p name="417e" id="417e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="1f62" id="1f62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not all experiences revolve around love and</p><p name="ef78" id="ef78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Love is important, yet no one writes why.</p><p name="ac58" id="ac58" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="fe24" id="fe24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of this expression is reflected in our flaws as individuals. We are all imperfect and so are our words, which is why we make assumptions in our expression as to who we really are as human beings.</p><p name="02a7" id="02a7" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="8c72" id="8c72" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="bbc6" id="bbc6" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="20ab" id="20ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">T.S. elliott had a graet quote</p><p name="86ec" id="86ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The unfortunate truth about peace is that it has no message.</p><p name="16e2" id="16e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those in happy relationships, those living fulfilling lives, where profit exists as a subtle consequence of action, don’t want or need to express who they are. Their expression is already in the present moment.</p><p name="a517" id="a517" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="74e6" id="74e6" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="de35" id="de35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However remember this and be very careful: always be humble in your assumptions.</p><p name="c9fe" id="c9fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humans very rarely call people out. I read a lot of these articles and it’s interesting not being inside these circles, because it’s like, “gee, at what point of the debate are we at</p><p name="e4c5" id="e4c5" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="db5d" id="db5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">now consider</p><p name="bca6" id="bca6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">While Medium may be honesty, that is not to say that we must not be truthful with ourselves. Perspective may be grand, however if it doesn’t fit into your own</p></div></div></section>
