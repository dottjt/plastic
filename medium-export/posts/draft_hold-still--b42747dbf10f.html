It’s a fuddled dream, and it’s difficult for me to truly think about the whole thing, however I dream that one day I will be able to write again. </p><p name="8a80" id="8a80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess I have a very complicated relationship with my words and I don’t quite know how to use them anymore. Perhaps I don’t read enough. No, I certainly read, however it’s a consciously destructive relationship and I’m not quite sure if it’s a relationship I can maintain.  </p><p name="7a2f" id="7a2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t treat them with respect. In a sense, I feel scarred by them. I used them to do things that I regret, like abuse people and hurt them, and now I don’t quite know what I’m doing with them. I feel as if they just fill up space. I don’t really know what kind of meaning I can derive from them, or for what reason.</p><p name="70ab" id="70ab" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why” is the big question I am trying to answer. I’m not sure why I write, or would want to write, nor do I feel like I have any stories worth telling. In part, I guess I get caught up in other people’s words as well. I take it very personally and it traps me within. </p><p name="faac" id="faac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to write stories, but also not go insane within the process. I’m not sure if that is possible by definition, however it is something I want to learn to try and conquer. It’s almost like trying to conquer your fear of heights or public speaking. You take it one step at a time and practice writing for a particular audience. I guess, think of it as a gradual stepping ground into a tiberium sunset. </p><p name="9aa1" id="9aa1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My first step is to find a story worth writing about. </p><p name="faa6" id="faa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It has to be a story that is worth writing about FOR ME, as well as for others. Maybe that’s always been the hardest part in my struggle that I’ve been unable to approach. I haven’t been able to pique people’s curiosity, though perhaps that is merely a fault of my own. </p><p name="164d" id="164d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Words simply haven’t been a medium of curiosity for me. </p><p name="a72a" id="a72a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Could it be that I know too much about them, or assume the arrogance that I do? </p><p name="97c9" id="97c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I think too much about other people’s stories, their success and their approach towards things. Still, it’s a perplexing question I’m still trying to understand and answer.</p><p name="b1c0" id="b1c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I need to find my own qualities and principles and work on them. </p><p name="70e2" id="70e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most important quality is to stay calm. In a sense, words don’t allow me to do that. They merely clog up my mind and in a sense, I use them as a tool for my OCD. </p><p name="cccf" id="cccf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it can be useful to use words as a form of meditation.</p><p name="4ffd" id="4ffd" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
