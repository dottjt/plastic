Have I told you that before? Well, of course I have, otherwise you wouldn’t be continuing to smile so brilliantly. You see, I actually own you and control you, which is why you function with a superb sharpness, emanating with a fine glee and awesome du jour. </p><p name="4f30" id="4f30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am perplexed at the complete stillness of the scenery perched upon my window. Not the kind of stillness which is ready to pounce at any given moment, but struken by fear and </p><p name="09d7" id="09d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mother’s birthday is tommorrow. Obviously I won’t be there to celebrate, however it’s not like I’m actually in the headspace to care. In fact, I don’t think we’ve celebrated each other’s birthdays for quite a few years now, to a point that we don’t even acknowledge it anyone. I don’t even think we saw each other at all on the past two years worth of birthdays and that’s just fine and dandy. </p><p name="877b" id="877b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s made me realise how bad things already were with mum, which was always apparent, yet is probably beginning to affect me. I will say this: I just hate the bitch. Okay, that’s entirely unfair. I don’t hate her, I just feel completely indifferent about her, which is probably much worse. I don’t feel compelled to expend  my emotions on her, anymore than I do to appease my own sense </p><p name="81b8" id="81b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">. I doubt we could have been more distant as a family. In retrospect, we were both cowered in fear over our loyalty for each other. On the one hand, I depended on her for my rent. I mean, a large part of family is the roof it provides over your head </p><p name="e79a" id="e79a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In retrospect, despite the somewhat hard ass attitude she would commonly display, she was actually a woman of fear.  </p></div></div></section>
