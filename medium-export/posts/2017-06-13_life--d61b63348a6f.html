It’s nasty.</p><p name="6d95" id="6d95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hopelessly devoid of nutritional content, and most of us fail to deal with the cathartic stain hanging above our heads, begging us to crumble like sweet apple pie.</p><p name="6f8b" id="6f8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gobble, fuckin’ gobble. I see you right there.</p><p name="7151" id="7151" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Cowering like a dead man. Fearing in resolution. Failing to breathe in celebration of the resounding lull that rings in our ears, telling us to grab another biscuit or perhaps a gun from the cellar to bring to parity the thoughts disappearing without trace from our consciousness.</p><p name="d521" id="d521" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, listen here punk.</p><p name="56a6" id="56a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ve placed your hand too close to the cup and now there’s FUCKING. TEA. EVERYWHERE.</p><p name="5d78" id="5d78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">YOU COMPLETE FUCK.</p><p name="1420" id="1420" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CUT OUT THE CRAP AND DRINK THE FUCKING BETTERAGE LIKE I ASKED YOU TO, YOU… YOU… I HATE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH.</p><p name="536c" id="536c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, most of us choose to fall into dissociation with the world around us, tumbling into the hands of others, pandering away at the splattered pie we find running along the walls of our misery, collaborating with the sludge we eat and splurge, now burning the edges of our mouths with the subtle crisp of it’s whispy flakes, as if cut by an artisan along the crevice of life’s most useless words.</p><p name="3497" id="3497" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most certainly, a vast majority of us try to create the illusion that life is bearable by committing ourselves to a pathway, a persona, a character, to absolutely anything we can latch ourselves onto and identify with.</p><p name="f59c" id="f59c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some kind of inseparable tautology we shove down our throats and consume like cultured tea, in the hope that it will bring us closer to who we ‘truly are’.</p><p name="0a85" id="0a85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We craft elaborate lies, intricate malaise, cunning grandeur — packaged so delicately into feeling and emotion, in the hope that one day our dreams will transpire into the fairytale vision our minds have worked so hard to conjure.</p><p name="3003" id="3003" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet no picture is perfect, and like a coddled child wrapped in crinkled cellophane, we stare into the mirror and we cry at the flawed ideology caressing our whim, deforming our intentions without even a hint of hindsight.</p><p name="3e6b" id="3e6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It lingers and tangles, it suffocates and flesh. We welt until our tears turn sour into curdled blood, misaligned and spraying all over the inconsequential drudgery selling itself short and flimmer. It’s a disorganised jamboree and your soul has been lost to the self-harm you paraded as spiritual healing.</p><p name="05ad" id="05ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fuck you and die, because that’s just what you were supposed to do when Sir John kneeled at the altar and prayed for your sins.</p><p name="6367" id="6367" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe that’s why couples divorce.</p><p name="0930" id="0930" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe it’s because they no longer see the identity in their marriage, no longer understand the meaning behind their actions, and even though they’ve created something physical, something inherently innocent — that desire to no longer deal with the impending difficulty of life has finally struck it’s ugly chime, in a desperate attempt to recreate the dream they envisioned years ago.</p><p name="b889" id="b889" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So with a new set of old eyes, they gorge on the possibility of becoming absolutely nothing at all.</p><p name="08ff" id="08ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They squander on a thin limb, bashing and thrashing about — confusing even those who see the best in them. They deliberately smile. They hurt with promise. And the tune they speak turns the orchestra away; an unemployed heartache leading to poverty and destitution.</p><p name="5f57" id="5f57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, it’s an easy choice to make.</p><p name="0ffa" id="0ffa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You stop thinking, and you start living. Like plugging yourself back into the generator, it doesn’t feel good to be so juiced up on artificial premonition, but at least it gives you a reason to swim.</p><p name="8067" id="8067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are the sailor, stupid.</p><p name="7f9c" id="7f9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Now row that fucking boat until the illusion fades away.</p></div></div></section>
