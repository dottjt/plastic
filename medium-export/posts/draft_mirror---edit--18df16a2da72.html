It was a very odd relationship that I’ve been trying to interpret for a while and I think I have a clearer picture of what was going on.</p><p name="a1d9" id="a1d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was something about her that was a little too perfect. She claimed to be autistic, posing magical abilities such as photographic memory. To complicate things further it was very difficult not to believe her, though whether it was true or not is impossible to say. She would talk about her beliefs of magic and fairies and it would entice you into a trance of wonder. Part of you would be drawn into her fantasy world, like the memory of a sensitive touch that never quite goes away.</p><p name="536f" id="536f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">God knows how many people she slept with, nor under which circumstances.  That really was a key talent of hers, to just approach strangers in public for sexual favours in a clear innocence that cannot be questioned. </p><p name="658c" id="658c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, she was a product of my own desire and ignorance. There was something about her that was a magical fit, though eerily horrible at the same time. </p><p name="ce0e" id="ce0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Ultimately, our encounter reminds me of something which we all cannot escape. At the end of the day, we are all a simple product of our environment, whether we like it or not. </p></div></div></section>
