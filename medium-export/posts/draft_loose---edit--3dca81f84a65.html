Bright squares of exquisite delight chewing through the glass interior, spilling blood all over the loose rose petals our fingers crave without consequence. Truly, if I could describe the cold shudder clawing away at my neck, undefined in a subtle whiteness consuming my vision… oh, please stop talking. It’s starting to give me an unpleasant cramp. </p><p name="5a38" id="5a38" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How beautiful Tommy,” the girl remarked, idling her body over an unconsumated sigh. In the few moments of dread and worry it took to precede her forethoughts, the workings of a weak smile emerged from a bouquet of distaste. “You don’t suppose you could be… a little more calculated in the perpetual linger you profess, hmmm?” Tommy looked up in a haste of enthusiastic bewilderment, confused without even a hint of pleasure. </p><p name="9ff5" id="9ff5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The word was undefeat. </p><p name="a632" id="a632" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Never had Tommy felt so restless, so benign in the unyielding clamature of words and non-sensical joy pounding his skull. “Now you listen here you! You bad Tommy!” As Tommy sat there, wagging his tail without remorse, he knew something wasn’t right with the master booming above. Was it the inconsistent stream of crack flowing through her veins, depriving her of the non-consensual admission which had happened earlier in the day? </p><p name="a50f" id="a50f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Possibly. Though for Tommy, a three year-old Frenchie dressed in a petite sailor outfit, wasn’t the kind of thought ready for an easy solution. “You’re a rancid one! I know you are, I’ve seen it! All you ever do is hurt and cry and pretend like there’s nothing else more in this, this wonderful world!!!” Tommy rolled onto the floor. It was beginning to get to him. From the straw ashes of his disgrace, like a soft piece of meat dripping from the bone, it suddenly became  clear. The girl was mad. </p><p name="6fe3" id="6fe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a compassionate raise of compulsive heartache, Tommy </p><p name="7cba" id="7cba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even his followers were beginning to question the seemingly pointless gratitude unspent in his wisdom.</p><p name="b5e9" id="b5e9" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
