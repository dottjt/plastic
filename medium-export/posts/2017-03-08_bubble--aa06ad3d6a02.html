Let me tell you bout’ the bubble.

<section name="f2d4" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="1cbb" id="1cbb" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">bubble.</h3><p name="ebd5" id="ebd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Let me tell you bout’ the bubble.</p><p name="8bfa" id="8bfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bubble is… well… we all know the bubble is a perfect place.</p><p name="f1da" id="f1da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bubble doesn’t neeeeeed to be intoxicating in order to be sanitary. It’s the kind of thing you’d be happy to feed to your children, only to find them smiling on the carpet with a clove of dishwashing gel smeared across their PLAYFULLY BASHING THMSELVES INTO A DULLED START OF PRE-PACKAED EUPHOIA.</p><p name="5b10" id="5b10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Listen Jebediah, the children are happy and the point is, you should be too.</p><p name="6a8d" id="6a8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose you could say that the bubble is a skill, which largely means it’s a choice you consciously make in your own mind, sort of like having sex with your best friend or molesting a bag of candy with your grubby, insoluble hands.</p><p name="414b" id="414b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You make the &lt;insert-state-of-mind&gt; decision to join the bubble and become at peace with the bubble, and certainly it’s a decision you learn to become comfortable with — cause we ain’t afraid of reality, you dumb tripe, and the sass in this room has absolutely quadrupled since your arrival.</p><p name="ec87" id="ec87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, silly you.</p><p name="013e" id="013e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And by gosh, I really do like the way you’ve brushed your hair today, cause it’s like you actually gave a shit to look your best, and that’s a pretty cool trait, wouldn’t ya say?</p><p name="c70a" id="c70a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Listen, I love the bubble, because when you stop to think about it…</p><p name="006d" id="006d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stop.</p><p name="eb5f" id="eb5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Seriously, stop.</p><p name="1f63" id="1f63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then stop again.</p><p name="819b" id="819b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t think about it. Don’t even move.</p><p name="d1f0" id="d1f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a clear contradiction standing right behind you and it’s holding a gun to your head and seriously, I know I’m talking way too quickly, but just let it blow your brains out all over the wall and carpets because mum loves you and you’ve got piss running down your leg and it’s absolutely hilarious.</p><p name="6f8b" id="6f8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the spiel: When you…</p><p name="6487" id="6487" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh wait, you may not notice this, as I haven’t yet told you, however please let the author finish because he has immense self-esteem issues and his wife is a fat whore, who is currently attempting to squander his riches.</p><p name="8219" id="8219" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, the kind of riches that my poor working hands have endured. Anyway, the contradiction is quite serious.</p><p name="fc05" id="fc05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Okay, seriously. I will hit you.</p><p name="4a0e" id="4a0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I AM VIOLENT. I AM AN IRRATIONAL MAN and like a donkey packed to the rim with steroids and explosives, I will combust at any given moment and take your children down too.</p><p name="6b1f" id="6b1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you FEEL that? The milky exterior of the bubble, that fucking immaculate excuse of enforced confinement, taunting you and ripping you apart, and into your thoughts. Telling you lies, that you’re stupid, that you’re smart, that you don’t have it, that you’re king WELL I CAN’T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE AND THROW IT ALL AWAY MISTER CAUSE THE PLASTIC WILL SMEAR</p><p name="f073" id="f073" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Interesting.</p><p name="0d8c" id="0d8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bubble, that white-wash of pre-conceived expectation laundered ever-so beautifully through reality, as if time were a gateway to our most intimate desires, is nothing more than a prejudice we pretend to distort and ignore, as if to say that the whole charade was a simple illusion, that we thought cared more about US than we did IT.</p><p name="d89f" id="d89f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like the fools before you, there is absolutely nothing to hide. Cause a-one, and a-two, and a-three. four. five!</p><p name="c414" id="c414" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Six. Seven.</p><p name="5bcf" id="5bcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eight? Nine.</p><p name="7f49" id="7f49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What most people don’t realise is that the bubble cannot co-exist with choice. So really, you’re either making good decisions or shitty decisions.</p><p name="3a31" id="3a31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nothing less. Nothing more.</p><p name="775a" id="775a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">*pop*</p></div></div></section>
