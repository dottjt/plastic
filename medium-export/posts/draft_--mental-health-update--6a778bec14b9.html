My fingers tumbled. My eyes disintegrated. The plastic on my face melted into the seams of my pants and the world was never quite the same again.</p><p name="eac5" id="eac5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And as amazing as that would be to believe, none of this actually happened. Instead, I’d decided to come out to my partner about my mental health.</p><p name="7707" id="7707" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, it was an incredibly difficult thing to do. As a fiercely independent person, I’m not the kind of person who likes asking for help. </p><p name="30e2" id="30e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mental health was something that had been bothering me for a while. I think I’d realised that I’d hit the limit in terms of what I could achieve as an individual. And don’t get me wrong, there was so much that I was doing that was right. I was maintaining a consistently healthy diet, I was lifting weights three times a week, I was taking cold showers everyday and I was blah, blah, blah.</p><p name="d0dd" id="d0dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, I wasn’t exactly where I wanted to be. I still couldn’t quite beat my porn addiction. I was still finding myself in a place in a regular cycle of mania (even though I’d reduced my cycles significantly) and part of me knew that I could do better. The main thing was that I was hiding my bad habits from my partner, and it’s almost impossible to get better and overcome something if you’re also lying about it to someone. </p><p name="bf19" id="bf19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose what struck me most was how she didn’t know. She didn’t know I was bipolar and it almost shocked me. I mean, it wasn’t something I’d actively tried to hide — she simply did not know.</p><p name="e3a1" id="e3a1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
