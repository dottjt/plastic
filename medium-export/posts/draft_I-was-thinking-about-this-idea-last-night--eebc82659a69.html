I was going to write this post about how you relate to my mental illness, the way you capture my mind and how it assists in my unrelenting guilt. It’d be great, you know. I would write the thing, I would contact you and send it to you, then you would totally understand how I’m feeling and then we can put the whole thing to rest and I can finally feel somewhat free.</p><p name="f77f" id="f77f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I’ve tried doing this in the past and in my shortsightedness, I’d completely fuck things up, as well as make the situation, much, much worse. I’ve come to realise that there’s no point communicating with you. In my own mind, I don’t know who you are. There’s the person who exists in the real world, then there’s that giant fucking eight-foot statue I’ve erected of you in my mind, which interferes with my ability to respond.</p><p name="2e6a" id="2e6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s why I get really weird when I talk to you. I don’t really know who you are and part of me becomes paralyzed in your presence. I’m going to stop writing about this, because it would mean explaining why I get this way and quite frankly, despite how it may help, is not going to contribute towards my mental health.</p><p name="459e" id="459e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to say that I’m lucky, in that I finally feel like I’ve been able to experience what I did to you. Which, you know, isn’t lucky at all, but at least has allowed me to change. Effectively, what happened is that I decided to disown my own mother and it’s interesting to note the similar parallels between us: Her complete and utter disregard for my own personal feelings, her complete lack of empathy, her destructive hypocriticism; a dangerous concoction of mental ailment.</p><p name="c511" id="c511" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, I picked it up from her and sure, that does not justify my actions, but that’s just life. I know she’s sad. I know she’s probably desperate to reconnect and have me back into her life, however I know I cannot. It would not serve anyone any good.</p><p name="2ce3" id="2ce3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, I forgive her. I forgive her and I don’t want to hold anything against her. She may have been a bad parent, as I have been a bad boyfriend, however that does not mean she is a bad person, nor that I should not help her. Equally, I also acknowledge that she’s toxic to my life and that I need to keep my distance. I need to take time away from her, perhaps indefinitely, for both of us to change and become better people.</p><p name="ae8a" id="ae8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s also made me realise that I need to keep my distance away from you, which is why I decided it would not be a good idea to contact you, no matter how glossy my apparent delusion was about a simple conversation, say, over cheese or something. I acknowledge that you yourself are toxic to me, if not for the immense delusion I have created over your image.</p><p name="2adc" id="2adc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had a terrible morning, however I feel a lot better now. I was more-or-less on the verge of tears while listening to Circa Survive. There’s a particularly lyric in the first song of Violent Waves which goes: “we must learn to be lost graciously.”</p><p name="f0f0" id="f0f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I certainly feel as if I have no choice but to be lost graciously, which in a sense, is a battle I will always be facing in the might of my insecurity. Of course, that’s assuming that I’m going to continue living in fear and insecurity, which I will not. It wasn’t until I got on the bus that I decided I was going to change. I popped on my mental health audio sessions and it helped a lot.</p><p name="6af4" id="6af4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mind feels like a murky haze. My ability to think isn’t quite stellar, but at least I know where I want to be. It’s really hard and I more-or-less feel like crying, but I won’t allow it. I’m too tired and exhausted to pity myself, however I’m there. Ready to explode.</p><p name="7a4f" id="7a4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">{��yUe�</p></div></div></section>
