Despite the horrendous train wreck that was yesterday, I woke up today feeling much calmer, almost serene like, as if quaint purposefulness had graced me by the shoulder and raped me. Oh wait, I’m sorry? Did it just get really dark in here all of a sudden? Have a petty reward and an insignificant bounty.</p><p name="6fca" id="6fca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lingo bingo, who gives a shit. Not the candy bar, you fuckwit. Oh, why bother. Purposeful and quaint they said. What an idiot.</p><p name="e93a" id="e93a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s something beautiful about stringing along a sentence of words. I think it brings out the best in me, even if it does spill its guts out all over the fucking upholstery. Let the bloody concoction of organ and diaspora ruin the whole fucking thing until nothing remains. Nothing but a stupid reminder of how we could have all walked away with something better than this. You know, THIS.</p><p name="7a48" id="7a48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Usually, my writings are about degradation, intimidation and other kinds of -tion type words, somewhat preoccupying and festering within my own rotting heart, but that just seems to be this month’s flavour of motion — splatter and plat.</p><p name="eb9f" id="eb9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m quite sure these words will never be read by another human being, what against the gargantuan marketing machine that is the internet, however that doesn’t bother me. While these words aren’t for anyone else in particular, I still find them to be more meaningful than the billions of other words out there. This is because they’re my words, no one else&#39;s.</p><p name="8ba9" id="8ba9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is my narrative, my life, my story, and that is something which no one else can capture, nor convey, without prying these solemn eyes from their leaking sockets, transplanting them into a rigid, somewhat negated-past that shall not bestow your realm.</p><p name="a517" id="a517" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s freezing right now. The house is like a prehistoric cabin; once designated to hold game meats for the musketeers at the fire of silence. There’s something about the vague tinge of yellow in these white walls that speaks to you in a sunken tone. The mood is quiet and the air is thin, like the very veins slowly pumping through my arms, functioning diligently, without fact or requirement.</p><p name="3e04" id="3e04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s nothing more comfy, nor falsely dignified, than acquainting yourself within your own bed, cuddled up with a blanket and a coconut smoothie. Okay, the last part is perhaps a little too facetious for the kind of weather we’ve been experiencing lately, however at the very least, it is fair to say that I’ve been starting to eat healthily again.</p><p name="ee14" id="ee14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be good. To be clean.</p><p name="da7a" id="da7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Okay, aside from the recent craze of porn addiction currently raving about in my head, you know, that thing which causes my depression, which mind you, I cannot seem to win these days; choosing to respect my body isn’t entirely out of the picture. I might even workout, though perhaps after a cheeky peek on Chaturbate… again. I think it’s been my third time today. I really should do something about those gorgeous, bouncing… maybe I should ask less of myself. I can’t be expected to solve all the world’s problems at once.</p><p name="277f" id="277f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next to me, on the bed, is my drawing pad. You know, a pad I use to draw on. I’m really proud of the progress I’ve been making this week with my drawings, which pre-date the appearance of this week’s mental circus, which finds exquisite, my ability to play victim with the personality trapped within my own mind. I can tell I’ve been getting better (at the drawing, not the mental retardation), but obviously I’m lacking in technique to progress further with my abilities. Andrew Loomis, to the rescue.</p><p name="e15e" id="e15e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it’s one thing I’m going to do today, it’s relax, sit back and not worry (too much) about the world around me. My girlfriend isn’t here this weekend, which means I get a lot of alone time to myself, and I’m going to chill like it’s 1999. I think I was six years old at the time, at least according to modern mathematical calculation, but we all know how modern Arabia turned out.</p><p name="afe5" id="afe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have a few plans for today. Eat. Draw. Watch TV. Play Dragon Age: Origins. Maybe even record a video for my YouTube channel. Hell, I know I probably won’t do half of those things, but the best thing is that it doesn’t even matter. I’m calm, exhausted, though calm, and clearly too ambitious for my own good.</p><p name="be60" id="be60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess it’s natural to want to forget about the massive amount of lasagne I consumed last night. You know, those dire times when you think it’s a good idea to ‘hate eat’ yourself to death, because let’s be honest: lasagne has no place in society outside of the circle of self-loathing we all seem so familiar with.</p><p name="7a54" id="7a54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not quite sure what to make of the internal mania that has transpired this past week. All I know is that I’m trying to make a concerted effort to put it all behind me. Aside from the whole “moving-out-of-home” and living with my girlfriend thing, I think my daily commute has affected me the most. I have to wake up and leave significantly earlier than I normally would and the transition between three different public transport routes is beyond taxing.</p><p name="f363" id="f363" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We will get through it. One step at a fucking time. Hello brain. Love me brain. Fuck you brain.</p><p name="6a53" id="6a53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The whole transition has taken a significant toll on my energy and mood. Man, I really don’t want to talk about it. I’ve got better things on my agenda than to rummage through my internal disgrace, like a homeless man digging through a bin at the bus shelter for a meal. I get it. The homeless need to eat too, but I ain’t doin’ no sexual favours for a person who smells like rotting oatmeal.</p><p name="9bb7" id="9bb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For some reason, I’ve been feeling a lot closer to my father lately, which considering I don’t think about him at all, is probably something significant. I guess I feel like I can relate to his leaving my life. Mum is certainly unbearable and completely lacking of empathy at the best of times, and while dad was certainly no candidate to be a supportive father, I often suspect that my mother’s insecurity and broken self-worth was enough to teach her a thing or two about cultivating failed relationships.</p><p name="d98c" id="d98c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For all I know, the man could be dead. Perhaps he is and that’s okay too. Life is designed to fall apart eventually and with such low rates on pessimistic attitudes, these days, there has never been a better time to dilapidate an arm or two. Hell, you may even get a few seconds of sympathy and fame, as the swaths of common caternarious continue to seek innovative ways to stick it to the big guy.</p><p name="5ab8" id="5ab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pathetic humility is one of those things that cultivates a kind of surreal pain, which I’m sure haunts my father till this day. I don’t think it’s bad to be selfish, but it’s the least life can do when things like your failed relationship, turn sour and grey. Gee, what can I say. I think I understand what he went through, and maybe in that broken part of my mind, appreciate it a little.</p><p name="fb05" id="fb05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ugh, I don’t like myself. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, and I have no illusions that I will continue hating myself for a while. The addiction is weighing down on me heavily, like having your once-pernicular mind sapped away from you and then thrown in the bin.</p><p name="11a3" id="11a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know I care. Hear my voice as I say this: I know I care. I currently look like a crack addict, what with these droopy eyes from all the crying, however it’s not like it really matters anyway. I’m sure there are many high-functioning crack addicts in society. Why, just look in the mirror. Hello, crack addict. Please give me my life back.</p><p name="4fb5" id="4fb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like this new study that I’m in. It’s incredibly small, but it’s secluded. It has just enough room for a lamp and a desk, which really is every writer’s dream. The desk, though a cheap and nasty imitation of something stolen from the 1850’s, does the job just fine. Sure. It wobbles more than Tokyo on a casual prefecture, and the wood is barely composite enough to be considered plastic, however it’s my desk. I own the the thing and it’s great. Though seriously, it’s a fucking hazard and should be scrapped… if only it didn’t cost $20, including delivery. Absolute bargain.</p><p name="678d" id="678d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I cooked myself a healthy dinner. See, I can be normal, sometimes. To help with my addiction, I’ve been drinking nothing but hot water, with elements of squeezed lemon. I really think I’ll workout later tonight, as an ode to my health, though I’m still desperate to draw something.</p><p name="1b44" id="1b44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m assuming that my mother tried to get her sister’s partner to call me today, in order for her to contact me and tell me how sorry she is. You know, it’s a learning experience for both of us, particularly for her. What I find interesting is the parallel to my own situation with my ex. I think I can totally understand how annoyed she must be, and how she must view me as something obsessive because of my inability to let go, but it’s not like that. I promise.</p><p name="a144" id="a144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s like, you’ll forget about someone and have a sense of self-love for yourself, then when you get really depressed for completely unrelated reasons, all those bad feelings come surging back and you find yourself stuck back at square one; clawing at an old picture of you and the haze you don’t quite remember.</p><p name="d54f" id="d54f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s just one dick pic love. Okay, two dick pics if you count the other guy in the picture standing next to me, holding my junk aggressively, but please. I promise I have no intentions of throwing you in a sack and burying you alive. I too, just want to be normal like everyone else.</p><p name="927a" id="927a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Oh, who even cares at this point. We’re all battling our own demons and I’m glad to say that I can at least recognise mine. Not out of pride, but necessity. I will be free again, even if it means burying myself alive. Perhaps not.</p></div></div></section>
