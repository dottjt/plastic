(really lame)</h3><p name="e0be" id="e0be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I make no qualms of your tired existence. Extraction is not a holy task, especially when compared to the pursuit which bought you here. I mean, I can barely make sense of the ramblings in your contradiction and its best we stop our conversation right here.</p><p name="29fe" id="29fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe it’s the tilt in my head, slowly churning away at the tendons dangling from my bone. Life, oh dear, cowering in the corner, intimidated (for lack of better word) at the almost shallow recognition that my mind fails to preoccupy. Do you like your tea or is it true what they say?</p><p name="e96a" id="e96a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not bad. Not great, though not excruciating enough for me to reject you and throw you down the river. The food itself is terrible and my mistress has seemingly disappeared after a long bout of anorexia. Oh, don’t worry. You can sink more teeth into a flat exterior than a woman full of substance, like a kind of lifeless anaconda attempting to strangle you from the inside.</p><p name="50ba" id="50ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Listen, if you can’t hold it down and break its neck, then you probably haven’t discovered the truth to this pitiful success you clamor. Please shut your mouth. Pour some soul into it. Drink it, if you must. There are no curious tasks as far as the mind is concerned and that is entirely fair assessment, given the truly meaningless nature of the huffing and puffing in tight circles that our culture would suggest; a kind of euphoria that gets shoved scruff down our throats from the occasional apple pie.</p><p name="25b5" id="25b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Take the time to explain what it means. Demonstrate your ability to explain. Use big words with confused meanings. Do you speak German? Dig in deeper than is humanely necessary and choke it, bleed it, and do whatever you have to do to make sure the fucking thing cries… and then spit on it for good measure. My, your product is truly beautiful. It glows with an almost unrecognisable evanescence, decomposing at the seams as was conceived from the very method we have taught you.</p><p name="1997" id="1997" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">May I touch it? Of course, I will. It is mine after all.</p><p name="6a74" id="6a74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, I’ve been looking at this thing for a while and I really cannot understand the utility of what this delightful little creation does. I understand that it has been extensively approved by seniors and artists and folk with much aptitude on many different subjects, and I’ve noticed that the market has taken a liking to your little “thing”, however it’s ever evasive in what it achieves and quite frankly, barely holds together. Does it achieve? Are you lying to me?</p><p name="3ce2" id="3ce2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m sorry partner, however it’s time to let you breathe. Yes, breathing hurts the soul and quite often promotes poor practice, though don’t let the discouragement bring you down. I promise it gets better with time. Now fuck off. Dyslexic bitch.</p><p name="6997" id="6997" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="7d8b" id="7d8b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
