You’ll murder your own mother if you have to, and that’s part of the conflict going on in my head. On top of the complete irrationality, I also have to deal with the consequences of my anxiety, like a kind of proverbial parking ticket you don’t quite understand, yet have gracefully accepted in the wake of your misdemeanour.</p><p name="1cf8" id="1cf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You become desperate when you feel like you’re cornered. You do what is “wrong”. You approach feelings which shouldn’t be approached. You provoke and tear. You do everything but calm down and it is a trap which buries you until you give up in defeat, accepting the feigned disability you have become so familiar with.</p><p name="5e2a" id="5e2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m currently sitting here at my desk in complete fear. Well, what is living anyway? Maybe it’s that hollow feeling you get every time you want to kill yourself, but don’t have the courage to pull the trigger. I really like your bow tie. It’s really fucking distracting, which is probably good.</p><p name="a2d1" id="a2d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve stopped caring. No really, I just took the time to vomit the $15 I spent on lunch today, which mind you I barely ate because I fucked up and ordered the wrong thing, because I feel sick for no apparent reason, other than because I’m anxious about absolutely nothing.</p><p name="a1ba" id="a1ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I don’t really know who to believe, or even what I should do. Everything is racing like a stampede of irrationality and absolutely none of it makes sense.</p></div></div></section>
