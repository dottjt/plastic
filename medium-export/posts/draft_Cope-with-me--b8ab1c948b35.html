I don’t exactly understand this idea behind coping.

When you struggle, it is because you feel as if there is no forward process. It is because you feel as if you’re battling with something you cannot quite apprehend and it protrudes an air of hopelessness that eats into your brain. </p><p name="14e7" id="14e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The interesting thing about these tid-bits of logic is that there actually is no difference between coping or struggling at all. </p><p name="1698" id="1698" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coping and struggling are the exact same thing portrayed in different lights, in the subtle difference between optimism and pessimism, reflected in our personal explanatory style and mental world view. The reason I currently don’t understand coping is because admittedly, I’ve had a pretty shitty mental health week. </p><p name="5b64" id="5b64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, it doesn’t matter if you’re usually happy most of the time or sad one half of that exact same time. The moment toxic people clamour into your life, the whole system of confined misery breaks down in a non-existent trip of guilt and attention, as if your own sense of self decides to break it’s arm and bleed out into gangrene. </p><p name="03e1" id="03e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thing have gotten worse with my mother. In fact, the title of mother rings a little audacious to my petty ears: she’s more like a stranger who provides me with a place to live.</p><p name="a32b" id="a32b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t mind the fact that I cook all my own meals, pay for all my own utilities and facilities. Over the years, I’ve been slowly pushed away into an otherworldly, dark place in history. We don’t talk. We usually don’t see each other for days and when we do, you can almost feel the tensity in the air. She’s recently moved me upstairs away from her “living quarters”, where I have my own makeshift kitchen and am self-sufficient on just about everything. </p><p name="97fe" id="97fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, have I told you that she’s recently gotten into Scientology? </p><p name="533a" id="533a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All this complexity, brewing like a primordial cesspool, made me realise something which broke me down on the inside. It made me realise what a complete and utter stranger I was inside the very place I call home and the struggle resumed it’s ugly position in my life. Oh please, don’t you remember me? </p><p name="a134" id="a134" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somehow I’ve always coped with the increasing distance. Hatred. Optimism. Drugs. The idea that I would soon move out with my girlfriend and get away from it all. The past year has been quite rosy in my quest to cope, having given up the drugs, hatred and addictions in favour for long term goals and career aspirations. </p><p name="4522" id="4522" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not always easy to deal with these feelings of being unwanted. This hatred tends to transpire into energetic daydreams; moments where I become so violent, so angry in my mind, that my thoughts become consumed and anxious in making others suffer that I have to snap out of it.  </p><p name="35a1" id="35a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel entirely unwanted. I feel unsafe. I feel insecure and I find it incredibly difficult to deal with these feelings. </p><p name="ee10" id="ee10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet it was that one idea which was powerful enough to convince myself that I was truly struggling, rather than coping, in-spite of the subtle changes in circumstance. </p><p name="ffef" id="ffef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Love and safety, or a sense thereof, does not live in the physical world. It is a place, a feeling that exists in your mind which highlights the importance of distinguishing between the emphasise we have on our emotions. Yet to know that you don’t feel loved, that you don’t even feel safe in the very place, is a very threatening feeling.</p><p name="0563" id="0563" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It makes you feel small. It makes you feel as if you are nothing and it is a such a silly trigger that you couldn’t possibly think anything of it. Furthermore, it hurts to hate your own mother. It hurts even more to think that you effectively do not have a mother and yet we internalise and normalise all this hate and negativity to the point that it becomes normal to us.</p><p name="c5bb" id="c5bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet when you really look at what you’ve become, all the things that you have done to cope with who you are and your circumstances, you realise that you’re a freak. </p><p name="e59c" id="e59c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re a freak because your life is fucked up and it becomes so apparent and real to you that your mind runs in panic like a dog covered in sausage meat. </p><p name="c15e" id="c15e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I had to pinpoint the absolute, most damaging aspect of my childhood, it’s that I was not taught to love unconditionally. I was taught instead that love is entirely conditional</p><p name="32c6" id="32c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My father left me when I was a child and I guess in some ways, my way of dealing with it was to suppress the feeling of love. The act of saying “I love you” never really meant much to me as a child. It was never heartfelt. Someone would say it to me, and I would say it to them. It felt more like an obligation out of fear and etiquette, rather than something that had true meaning. </p><p name="f17d" id="f17d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They were just words to me, nothing that truly internalised. I suppose that’s why I have such a dark sense of humour. Words are just silly play things to me: they don’t have any real meaning. No pretense to shock or offend. Completely shielded from the world around me.</p><p name="0ebd" id="0ebd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It wasn’t until my first relationship that it actually felt like, “wow, so this is what love actually is” and it was an incredible insight to had. I suppose I only really had escapes as a child: dopamine pleasures. I loved video games, though clearly they were not meaningful love experiences for a child to have. I loved pornography. I was always born inadequate into this world. </p><p name="a201" id="a201" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s important to understand that the transition from coping to struggling is subtle. At first it began as a feeling of uncomfort. I felt stressed, but I didn’t quite know why. This was all happening during the holiday period where I was at home, as opposed to working full-time in an office, so I felt that maybe it was a consequence of no longer being bound to rountine. </p><p name="ee4d" id="ee4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Later this transpired in an itch to leave the house and as my mood progressively worsened, it soon began to tumble where I one day woke up and had my first urge to masturbate in more than four months. That’s when I knew I would be up for one mighty struggle that would consume me for days. </p><p name="dbad" id="dbad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I decided to cave into my porn addiction after four months of abstinence (the longest I have ever gone) and “difficult” barely describes how it felt to even consider loving myself. Anxious, agitated, hopeless and trapped. You get the gist. </p><p name="48b7" id="48b7" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b8fc" id="b8fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mother is so full of hate and is so irrational and blind, it’s insane. All I can say is that she’s started reading Scientology books and she tells everyone about how amazing it is. She strings on several men at once and the kind of men she attracts have a knack for enjoying abuse. She literally just shouts at them in frustration and somehow, they stay.</p><p name="c566" id="c566" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That was always the issue with my mother. She can’t compromise, has no sense of empathy or understanding and must have things her way. She cannot accept and arguably, has never accepted who she is.</p><p name="9c9b" id="9c9b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="5dfd" id="5dfd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would be lying if I said that I didn’t enjoy the freedom. I find not hearing her voice therapeutic. All we do is fight and we find each other unbearable. She is the kind of mother who will endless criticises you as a form of “help“ and is a large part of the reason why I have mental health issues.</p><p name="cb66" id="cb66" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="8016" id="8016" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is compounded by the fact that my mother absolutely hates my girlfriend. I think because she emphasises my waning dependence on her and eventually, I hope to move out with her within the next 6 months and evade the madness that is my mother’s judgement.</p><p name="393c" id="393c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, my girlfriend’s parents are no better and it’s been a year since I’ve been to her house. Her father is a pathological psychopath who is physically violent and is one of the most manipulative people I have ever met in my entire life. He will happily set you up to knock you down</p><p name="cedb" id="cedb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What makes my mother manageable is the fact that she’s a single mother and that I can hold my ground. In her case, she has two parents to deal with they gang up on her and provoke her. Easily, no matter what people say, she is one of the strongest women I know and it’s a deep respect I have for her.</p><p name="e0e7" id="e0e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So as you can imagine, there’s a lot on my mind at the moment. This is on-top of all the other trauma from my past which has decided to make a return. It’s like a flood gate has been opened and I’m barely staying above the wake.</p><p name="cb8e" id="cb8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hate the fact that I need perspective and self-awareness in my life just to function. It feels like an unnecessary burden and eventually, you break and feel worthless again no matter what perspective you gain because toxic people are like poison: until they are gone, they just continue to sickle in your blood and rot you from the inside.</p><p name="9314" id="9314" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sad thing about mental illness is that if I actually had supportive, understanding people in my life, I would probably be a doctor or an engineer by now. I have so much drive in life to succeed and do amazing things, but then I’ll be bogged down by the incessant harm of others that it just makes me want to give up.</p><p name="66ec" id="66ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m currently learning coding and computer science and I absolutely love it. I love the technical, engineering side of it and I love the creativity of problem solving.</p><p name="06f4" id="06f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to create brilliant things and I guess that’s why I’ve begun creating videos again. Humour is a way for me to cope and feel proud about who I am, even if I am insane.</p><p name="0bcd" id="0bcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s been a bad week in my life, however I am reminded that it’s not the last week of my life. I am a fighter and I will continue to fight, though hopefully, not with myself.</p><p name="854c" id="854c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
