You’re buying into a fantasy and you live in the real world, not in the world of fantasy. You are delusional. You are insane. Your mind isn’t right. It isn’t. So how do you deal with things that are not real?</p><p name="0d0d" id="0d0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You take a closer look at the agreements that you’re making in your mind.</p><p name="26c4" id="26c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, you’re not truly mentally ill. You’re just… well, you haven’t learnt how to control your thoughts. Remember when you could control your thoughts? Remember when you had the confidence to think and feel with integrity and how you wanted?</p><p name="fd61" id="fd61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humans forget. Perhaps we forget as a coping mechanism. We forget about the things that are important, because even perspective itself is a reminder that we’re fucked up and there’s a great deal of shame that comes with that reminder. So we pretend and it gets us through our day and it actually works.</p><p name="7057" id="7057" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My issue is that my mind is so preoccupied in the emotional reaction that I don’t see where it’s come from or how I’ve constructed it. All I notice is the slight brood in my thoughts. I don’t have the empathy or capacity to understand it as something that’s bullshit. I simply allow it to consume me, thinking that there is no other way of truly understanding the way that I feel.</p><p name="5517" id="5517" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So there’s the emotional reaction and that’s it. I stop there and I let it burn into my skull and preoccupy my mind.</p><p name="f8ca" id="f8ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s expand the mind. There’s the emotional reaction, then there’s the agreement. Oh wait, but you don’t see the agreement. Oh no, you certainly don’t. You only see the reality, the virtual reality of the mind that warps the agreement that you’ve made about reality.</p><p name="3a34" id="3a34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our mind is constructed by beliefs and instead of taking notice of belief, you only take notice of reality. In reality you have no opportunity to suspend your belief: You simply witness the flow of consciousness travel to places you wish your curiosity would never have dare questioned to begin with.</p><p name="7eca" id="7eca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These beliefs are bullshit. They’re founded on lies, yet because I cannot see them, because my mind is so preoccupied in reality, it feels as if they’re real, cradling me in their misery.</p><p name="c6ce" id="c6ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now whenever I have a thought or an emotion, I simply look towards my beliefs and understand that these lies are not born from love. It’s impossible to believe in a lie, no matter how hard it tries to touch you and scar you.</p><p name="29d3" id="29d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mind feels free. It feels like capable. It feels right at home, just where it should be, as opposed to a far-away place where existence is nothing but a shell.</p><p name="e15c" id="e15c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">VNSZ/s�p~@�</p><p name="9021" id="9021" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
