I also find it comforting to view my past through humour, rather than take it personally. </p><p name="b33c" id="b33c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, despite a lifetime of mental illness, a lifetime which has influenced my tastes in art and culture, I have also grown tremendously over the past couple of years to a point where I believe I can classify myself as no longer being mentally ill.</p><p name="e5e4" id="e5e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, I feel as if I am mentally healthy.</p><p name="2f86" id="2f86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I no longer feel the same kind of hopelessness, judgement, self-criticism, failure mindset that I used to. While I know it is still inside me, I no longer experience it. In fact, I believe it is aspect living inside EVERYONE, though clearly that is a story for another time. </p><p name="f96a" id="f96a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead I feel empowered and  for the first time in my life, to a point where I no longer think or worry about it. It’s like it’s not there and life moves on the important things, like building a family and focusing on your career. </p><p name="5acb" id="5acb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, it reminds me of those weed smokers (of which I used to heavily) who think it’s a good idea to take tolerance breaks every so often, as a way of enjoying a bigger high in the future. </p><p name="429b" id="429b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you think about it however, the great irony is that the moment when you tolerance truly resets is the moment when you truly forget about weed in your life and have no desire to do it. </p><p name="5bae" id="5bae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, having this control is not some kind of switch that flicks off in your brain. Instead, through a lot of practice, mindfulness and understanding, I know what it is I have to do in my head in order to make it work. </p><p name="0b86" id="0b86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mind you, it took years of practice and living, however I would like to think of it as a journey and as long as you’re always climbing towards the top of that mountain, you will eventually reach the peak. </p><p name="5b4b" id="5b4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One thing I’ve discovered is that having mental illness does not make you special or unique, nor does it make you human. Mental illness is merely an expression of mental illness, just as murdering is an expression of murder. </p><p name="4875" id="4875" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your actions become your character and so don’t be too surprised when it all comes tumbling down. Innocence on the other hand, is a tough character to maintain. </p><p name="5356" id="5356" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From my collective experience, I do not believe mental illness is mutually exclusive from mental health; they are both two different facets of the same thing. Oh, you know, that thing we call life. </p><p name="24a3" id="24a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s detriment that we spend so much time trying to describe mental illness, rather, describe society’s problems as a whole, because it merely solidifies and stigmatises the identity of what things are, which is neither effective, nor accurate, especially where change is concerned. </p><p name="735c" id="735c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Personally, I like using this identity to create art, however many use it as a political tool to try and express the worst of their mortality. </p><p name="9cee" id="9cee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a result, we do not focus on the things that truly do matter, which is to say, focus on the so-called “solutions” and work towards ending our misery. Of course that is not the culture we have culture ourselves into we. We instead believe that criticising the opposition can bring wealth. Good luck there mister. </p><p name="c625" id="c625" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Naturally this is difficult because of the way we perceive events. As a society we tend view things as solutions vs problems, optimism vs pessimism, rather than as a holistic, dynamic ecosystem that is neither moralistic, nor evil. </p><p name="ada6" id="ada6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is the reason we are still stuck in the left vs right paradigm, simply because we fail to adopt truthful dynamics as to the true nature of human life, as politics and society slowly crumble into a confusing, incomprehensible mess. </p><p name="347d" id="347d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is the reason we have more people on anti-depressants than ever before, as well as the millions upon millions of people suffering from extreme levels of mental illness. </p><p name="73aa" id="73aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have happily trapped ourselves and we have no idea why. </p><p name="c526" id="c526" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As an individual, I doubt there is much I can do to help and certain it is not my responsibility. I am neither a messenger, nor am I an informant. I exist for my own purpose and that is something which I hold proudly.</p><p name="d3ae" id="d3ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, maybe it will be of benefit if I instead describe what it means to be mentally healthy, so that you can have a complete picture of what life can be when you’re in-control. </p><p name="f91a" id="f91a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, these are aspects of my life which I believe I have mastered and allow me to be happy and free. </p><h4 name="e261" id="e261" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What mental health means to me:</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="85c7" id="85c7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">To be able to fully control the range of stories/images/trauma from my past that play in my like a tape in my mind.</li><li name="c0c5" id="c0c5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">To be able to dissolve the identities of guilt, doubt and negative emotions as being nothing more than a ruse. </li><li name="60fa" id="60fa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">To be able to prevent myself from rumination over the past.  </li></ul><p name="b87d" id="b87d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--li"><br></p><p name="9beb" id="9beb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am nothing extraordinary. Certainly I feel lucky.</p><p name="f3a8" id="f3a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the beginning it was hard. However through practice, all these things happen like a flashing light within my mind. Then I move on. </p><p name="4115" id="4115" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If there’s one piece of advice I could provide to people suffering from mental illness, it is to discover some kind of framework with which to understand your suffering. There are many frameworks out there, you just have to find the right one, kind of like shopping for a new car. </p><p name="ec22" id="ec22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The beautiful thing about having a framework is that it allows you to understand your mental illness from a top down perspective, rather than a bottom up perspective.</p><p name="884a" id="884a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we’re mentally ill, we tend to try and rationalise our feelings and emotions, without truly knowing what is going on in our heads, or how to prevent this repeated abuse. </p><p name="13ad" id="13ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One framework I personally recommend is <a href="http://www.pathwaytohappiness.com" data-href="http://www.pathwaytohappiness.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.pathwaytohappiness.com</a> </p><p name="919c" id="919c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know. It sounds new age as fuck and the website looks like it was made in the early 90s, however it was the first enlightening experience regarding my depression and while not perfect, works to a large extent.</p><p name="fe0c" id="fe0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In the future I hope to create my own framework, however I’m still currently learning the computer science skills to pull it all together. </p></div></div></section>
