<section name="6733" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f040" id="f040" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I think you have the right gist of what a narrative is, though as I say, it’s just an abstract description that is merely designed to help us better understand ourselves. Narratives are no more tangible than our ideas of what a belief or an ego is — these are merely self-created descriptions we have of reality to help us identify and understand who we are. In theory, these descriptions can be as vague or as real as you like.</p><p name="c713" id="c713" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is an important understanding to have, as placing too much importance on our descriptions is part of the reason why mental illness exists in the first place. We place so much emphasis on trying to describe our problems, we actually end up constructing them instead.</p><p name="05ee" id="05ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, you do (or rather, can) prevent narratives by not thinking about them. In fact, it’s very easy. You remind yourself that your particular narrative/thought is intangible and it dissolves away into the urethra. It’s almost like flicking off a switch in your mind.</p><p name="1c6f" id="1c6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hard part however, for most people, is coming to the understanding that you can do this. This is what takes people months, sometimes years to figure out and is a dedication to the learning of self-awareness practices.</p><p name="4455" id="4455" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Self-awareness is also difficult in that we can tend to lose this understanding months later, after neglecting these self-awareness practices. This is like with anything however: If you don’t use it, you lose it — however this is basic maintenance no different to eating and sleeping, and arguably, the pain of emotional suffering far outweighs dedicating a few minutes a day to self-awareness.</p><p name="be18" id="be18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel as if you hold many of the same misconceptions that most people have about self-awareness, and is in part, the reason why many people dismiss self-awareness as something silly.</p><p name="4dae" id="4dae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is understandable as self-awareness is a completely different way of thinking about reality; one that most have not experienced. You say that it must be difficult to live in the present moment, yet it only seems difficult because you have no process of how to get there.</p><p name="9863" id="9863" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the reason many people remain depressed and jaded their entire lives — they dismiss any such process and they assume that everything is naturally terrible, just as their own narrative tells them. I guess I was one of the lucky ones and truly, for anyone to gain a foothold over their mental illness is something to feel good about.</p><p name="0881" id="0881" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When your mind is so occupied by stress and self-hatred, it becomes impossible to imagine that life could be stress-free and happy. In many ways, self-awareness is like stepping out of your own box, which is why people feel a level of clarity whenever they have epiphanies or insights into their own lives</p><p name="5db7" id="5db7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To answer you question, I believe that narratives allow us to do one thing very well: experience delusion. Now, I won’t qualify whether this is a good/bad thing, however that is what they do and you can decide for yourself whether this is useful or not.</p><p name="5fe9" id="5fe9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I like to say, if you have two different tools and one tool does something better than the other, there’s no reason to use the lesser tool and I feel that way about narratives. Of course, the trade off is that living in the present moment is usually unfamiliar so I guess that’s an added difficulty some people don’t want to deal with and it is something I can empathise with.</p><p name="076a" id="076a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For most people however, they simply realise they don’t have the option because they’re so stuck within their own point of view, usually of the narrative.</p><p name="9f05" id="9f05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Admittedly I enjoy the experience of delusion though I do not believe this is healthy thing (hence my mental illness).</p><p name="9885" id="9885" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a lot of theories into self-awareness. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Agreements-Practical-Personal/dp/1878424319" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Agreements-Practical-Personal/dp/1878424319" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Four Agreements</a> is an amazing book that explains a lot of these concepts, however it’s ultimately lacking in that it doesn’t really explain how to achieve these states of mind.</p><p name="f1b5" id="f1b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For learning about self-awareness in terms of a framework (which really is the best way) pathwaytohappiness.com is really good and their audio series explains things very well.</p><p name="d026" id="d026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, we all have our own individual journey and there were many different books and articles I devoured before I could come to an understanding of self-awareness.</p><p name="d886" id="d886" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Of course, even now, I still barely know anything and can still be a wreck of a person at the best of times. I’m not perfect and I don’t hope to be. However I certainly feel a lot happier with myself and I no longer feel the same level of guilt, shame and negative emotions as I did with my former self.</p></div></div></section>
