I found it impossible to escape your image, reverberating like a constant echo inside my mind. Your voice would etch into my consciousness and dry me thin.</p><p name="8364" id="8364" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your reminder had laden me with an unbearable guilt that tore into my soul and ripped it apart. In retrospect, I have come to recognise that guilt was only one of the emotions that I would cycle through endlessly until exhaustion.</p><p name="f015" id="f015" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am not sure at what point my mind switched off and stopped thinking about you. It’s that curious case that when you stop thinking about someone, you’re not reminded by its lack of occurrence. It just sort of disappears and withers into thin air.</p><p name="5199" id="5199" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now I don’t think much about you and when I do, it feels more like a pointless afterthought, rather than a substantial burden on my mind. Perhaps my mind has exhausted from the million and one reasons my mind has conjured to justify our separation. Perhaps I’ve grown up. Perhaps I just wanted to move on.</p><p name="27cb" id="27cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I just stopped seeing the point of worrying. One idea that I’ve been holding onto dearly is that often the best way to inflict change is to be a positive role model who demonstrates their capability, rather than someone who lives in fear. Certainly I was no angel, however I do try to be the best person I can.</p><p name="b1ad" id="b1ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet deep down inside, part of me still feels obliged. While I find it easy to move on, I also find it difficult to let go. I don’t know if I’ve become so desensitised from the constant ringing in my mind or that I’ve finally dealt with you properly and rationally.</p><p name="b148" id="b148" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have learnt to be grateful. I have learnt to focus on the positive things in my life and certainly, I have areas in my life that I wish to explore and that truly fascinate me.</p><p name="0dd1" id="0dd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the first time in my life I feel as if I love who I am. I have career aspirations. I have wonderful friends in my life who allow me to express who I am and I have the most lovely girlfriend anyone could ask for.</p><p name="4694" id="4694" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like anything however, I’ve also come to realise that as long as you continue arguing with your demons, life will never seem like enough, which is part of why I decided to let you go. I believe I deserve better. Everyone deserves better.</p><p name="cf65" id="cf65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t spend a lot of my time feeling worried or being sad. My mind is focused on my goals. I spend most of my time reading coding books and writing. I have zero doubts about my future and who I want to become. I don’t feel scared of commitment. I am completely certain in who I am.</p><p name="ced0" id="ced0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However occasionally, in the shadow of my daily exhaustion, I sometimes reminisce about the people in my past. There’s something timeless about the past, that feels like it never changes, yet is evident in the present moment.</p><p name="f66e" id="f66e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The old Julius would be ashamed of who I am today. The old Julius would still be depressed, lying in bed, cultivating your voice like a holy lullaby.</p><p name="302a" id="302a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a strong part of me that could easily just give up everything I have and return back to that hopeless spiral. I am not completely immune from depression; however I am doing extraordinarily well beyond most people.</p><p name="2b6a" id="2b6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though none of that means anything if you don’t feel happy with who you are and I do feel happier with myself. Life is not easy (full-time work is confronting, to say the least) however that does not mean it cannot be pleasant. </p><p name="b0cc" id="b0cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most importantly, I feel empowered, with a very key difference. I don’t feel driven by anger, frustration or . I feel calm in my empowerment.</p><p name="cb98" id="cb98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not entirely sure why I decided to write this. I suppose I just wanted to get a few things off my chest. It makes me feel more comfortable with myself.</p><p name="8261" id="8261" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess it feels like I’m talking to you, which is what I want. At the same time, I don’t want to feel attached to you, though I feel like that will always be a part of me that I cannot help.</p><p name="a457" id="a457" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel safe within these words. There’s as far as I’m willing to go. </p><p name="c3b1" id="c3b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s words are why I feel free.</p><p name="8983" id="8983" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
