Admittedly I was experiencing a terrible hangover from the night before and in the middle of summer, was suffering like hot wind in world so incredibly empty. </p><p name="229c" id="229c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tutoring someone’s child is a very surreal experience, certainly something seasoned tutors experience on a daily basis. In a sense, you’re not their mother or father. You can’t force them to do anything. The dynamics, quite naturally, go far deeper than that. </p><p name="0b14" id="0b14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To add an extra layer of tension, the child’s father had passed away a year earlier. I remember, because I was at the hospital on the day of his death, thinking little of the ensuing moments. Lying in bed, unconscious, he passed away hours later. </p><p name="02e5" id="02e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He had two children at his time of death in late 2014. One was 8 and the other was 10. I was with the children at the hospital playing a jolly game of Smash bros on the hospital GameCube. It was the first time I’d actually ever really met or hung out with his children and they sure were a cheeky bunch. </p><p name="1539" id="1539" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The children were in grade 3 and 5 respectively. I was shocked to be informed of two rape incidents that had happened at their school; one incident where three boys in grade three had raped another girl and an instance where a girl in grade one was caught giving a blow job to another boy from grade one.</p><p name="9557" id="9557" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gee.</p><p name="0c34" id="0c34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Their father, in a very real sense, was my father. While we weren’t biologically related, a large part of my childhood was spent living with him and I called him dad and truly meant it. Frequently moving around as a child, there were moments where I lived with him, </p><p name="3ebc" id="3ebc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He felt like it down to my bones. </p><p name="d69b" id="d69b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mother was not romantically connected with him. They were just old friends, though who knows what the past contains. Yet that didn’t matter to me. A father is in the actions and responsibilities you take as a person, not the title you hold. </p><p name="3810" id="3810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…and he was the best possible father you could have. He was hard working. In fact, sculpture was his passion and it was his craft. </p><p name="1ff6" id="1ff6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Actually, growing up, I technically had two fathers. One was my biological father, the other was him. I still remember that incredibly awkward moment when they both momentarily met. I felt paralysed and didn’t quite know who to call dad, out of offending them both. I’m not even sure my biological father knew about our arrangement.  </p><p name="314c" id="314c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To this day, I’m still not quite sure who was more of a father to me. Certainly, there was a cerebral distaste for my biological father. In many ways, he was the opposite to my other father. I don’t think deadbeat is the right word, however he soon disappeared from my life and I haven’t seen him in over 15 years. </p><p name="8edd" id="8edd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was very odd growing up with two fathers, as you can imagine. I remember moments in my life where I was living away from my biological father for years at a time, only to live back with him and even after his permanent departure, was a string of eclectic, largely intoxicated men. </p><p name="8de9" id="8de9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though Personally speaking, I have a very fluid concept of what a father is. I think I was my own father growing up, teaching myself as I went along. In other ways, my mother was my father and the whole thing is just an inconvenient mess. </p><p name="d3c3" id="d3c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a talented Chinese sculpture, though I never paid much attention to it. My mother is an artist who has painted all sorts of famous people, which naturally, just blends itself into the incomprehension of life.</p><p name="7a44" id="7a44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In preparation of his funeral, I had to collect a series of works to show and I was astounded at the significant creations that he had managed to conjure. We are talking about massive, 20 metre installations, in every possible material you could think of. </p><p name="8eb5" id="8eb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was particularly fond of his bronze work. There’s something magnificent in the timeless creation of metal, forever locked away in the cast iron prefecture our minds will never truly understand. </p><p name="e7f4" id="e7f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was out of the blue that the children’s mother had approached me to tutor one of her children. </p><p name="c3c7" id="c3c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will be honest and say that I never liked her. She sort of came late to the party. She appeared one day while I was living with dad and he never truly accepted me. </p><p name="649f" id="649f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the next two months, I would tutor this child </p><p name="26e6" id="26e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was quite fond the child. I knew he was smart, but </p><p name="c1aa" id="c1aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ju had not completed his homework, again, </p><p name="29d8" id="29d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not sure if this is a story of Ju, or if this is some glorification of myself as a person. I’m sure the analysis transcends both of our souls, like a kind of bad soup mixed in with </p><p name="dda8" id="dda8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"> </p></div></div></section>
