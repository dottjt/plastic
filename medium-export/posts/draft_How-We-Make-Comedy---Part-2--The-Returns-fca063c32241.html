I knew my mind could not cope with the incessant self-depreciation and dicking around; all those petty notions of popularity and fame that had forced me into a box of assumptions so large, that it crushed me as an individual and destroyed me as a soul.</p><p name="637d" id="637d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, to claim destruction is a little a harsh. Rather, it fragmented me into an even more jaded and religiously hateful person.</p><p name="0160" id="0160" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arguably, I was too young and immature to embrace the responsibility of performing comedy; that fine-line between joking around and truly believing that you, the humble punchline, was nothing more than a sacrificial lamb for the masses to gouge at.</p><p name="ac31" id="ac31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I did not quite know it, I was mentally ill at the time.</p><p name="636e" id="636e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Naturally, growing up in extraordinarily cynical and malevolent circumstances from a young age will lead you to believe that everyone else is ruining your life, rather than yourself.</p><p name="fca3" id="fca3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I relied on my comedy as a personal expression of the madness uttering my mind, it was largely an expression that dug itself a little too deeply within the entrenched sod of my downtrodden nature.</p><p name="3b64" id="3b64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was an addicted, depressed, judgemental piece of crap.</p><p name="227a" id="227a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, that was hardly the reason why I stopped making videos.</p><p name="f655" id="f655" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you are mentally ill, you remain so eternally blind to your own flaws and reason that you illegibly chase the next hapful decision like a rat approaching poison in the middle of a disguised elixir.</p><p name="2001" id="2001" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had decided instead to focus on losing my virginity because “that was the real reason I was so fucked up”.</p><p name="4a33" id="4a33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you can imagine, this path in life merely developed into an even greater insecurity about who I was and eventually after a terrible string of dainty relationships, I decided it was best to focus on the cause of my mental illness, rather than the repetitive symptoms haunting me daily in the obsessiveness of my actions.</p><p name="dcb8" id="dcb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, it has been more than two years of shameless recovery and I am actually feeling quite good about myself.</p><p name="3b79" id="3b79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is like I have tricked my mind into being happy. Rather brilliant, I say.</p><p name="e0b6" id="e0b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am now lucky enough to have a full-time job in a career that my tattered journalism degree is entirely undeserving of. I have an amazing girlfriend whom I want to spend the rest of my life with and I really am incredibly grateful for simply being alive.</p><p name="a8fe" id="a8fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…and to think, I did not even need to pop a pill to get through it all (though actually, I was obsessively taking acid at the time, in the form of tabs).</p><p name="4ef7" id="4ef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back in 2013, in the depths of my silly mind, I was under the impression that the channel was going nowhere.</p><p name="6032" id="6032" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now realise, here in 2015, that I had actually squandered a wonderful opportunity.</p><p name="e15b" id="e15b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, I have zero regrets what-so-ever of the decisions I have made in my life. Taking that time off was the best thing I ever did for myself and I am eternally grateful to have had the courage to let go and leave my former abusive relationship with myself.</p><p name="1735" id="1735" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose I want to prove to myself that I am truly capable of achieving my goals and go against this notion repeated failure can ever define an individual. There is always opportunity lurking around the corner and it is a bright perspective for those who want it.</p><p name="913d" id="913d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, the reason why I am giving it another crack is because I know I have the talent to succeed. I know what I am capable of and comedy is truly the one talent where I can dominate and express myself clearly.</p><p name="1c98" id="1c98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only difference is that I need to actually need to stick with it this time, rather than allow the self-doubt to overcome me.</p><p name="0145" id="0145" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Interestingly enough, there was very little I enjoyed about making videos. I hated filming; arguably one of the most tedious tasks available. I hated acting; to an extent, and editing was okayish.</p><p name="7184" id="7184" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What really shined however, like a bright beating angel in my heart, was the final product; something which I could call my own and feel proud of.</p><p name="df11" id="df11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It makes me really, quite happy.</p><p name="9e88" id="9e88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you must know, I have always been somewhat obsessed with media. If I was not making videos, then I was producing podcasts or murmuring stupid voices to myself like a chatterbox for the queazy.</p><p name="8bce" id="8bce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can always tell how in-love I am with my media depending on the number of times I re-watch or re-listen to the thing I have produced. It does not matter if it is something I have written or performed; I have this habit of consuming it over and over again for days at a time and I always find it striking to discover something new with each iteration.</p><p name="9221" id="9221" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It reminds me of when I was starting out as a quack in community radio, avid as any 16 year old possibly could be.</p><p name="9945" id="9945" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After each show I would try to get home as quickly as possible so that I could edit the audio and listen back to the show.</p><p name="f6a4" id="f6a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would then proceed to listen to the week’s show on repeat until I was able to broadcast again for that same terrible hour, to which I would obsessively listen back again and again and again.</p><p name="faab" id="faab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps you cannot relate.</p><p name="bb54" id="bb54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I do not blame you for thinking I am insane.</p><p name="bb0e" id="bb0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These recent events have made me realise that there has been something missing from my dear life; something which once kept me up at night for hours at a time.</p><p name="678d" id="678d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That missing element was passion, and to experience this kind of passion again is the most blissful I have felt in a long while.</p><p name="400c" id="400c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To feel so compelled to do something; to a point that you are willing to spend hours a day perfecting the art with your every breath, is a privilege that very few people have to experience and it’s something I am wholly grateful for.</p><p name="e9a4" id="e9a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel like a new man.</p><p name="9484" id="9484" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it is one thing I have learnt from my departure, something which I now deeply respect and value, it is that there is no substitute for hard work — something which my mental illness abused endlessly.</p><p name="28ff" id="28ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I worked hard on my comedy, very rarely was I consistent. In-between videos I would fall into deep depressions. I would be rendered useless as the voices in my mind told me how worthless and pointless I was as an individual, relative to the disappointing waste of time that was my comedy.</p><p name="806e" id="806e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now-a-days however, I consider myself a confident, patient, hard-working individual and perhaps that is why I am so excited to be making videos again. I have aspirations of becoming big and I feel like nothing can stop me.</p><p name="4e8b" id="4e8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Above all, I have also come to realise that there is nothing more important that having sufficient mental health in life, no matter what your aspirations.</p><p name="e50f" id="e50f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without the ability to draw perspective from your environment, you are literally helpless and without the ability to control your mind, you may as well be virtually dead.</p><p name="9c0d" id="9c0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am not sure what prompted me to start experimenting with the camera again, but like a dam full of passion, the barriers just cratered below and my mind has become fixated on writing scripts and studying comedy since.</p><p name="da9a" id="da9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While away on a business trip, I decided to make a pilot episode and it was an absolutely joyous experience. I probably watched the video more than 100 hundred times back-to-back, over and over again.</p><p name="351a" id="351a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have decided to write these posts so that I can document and explore this side of my personality that I am incredibly fond of. Sure, I am no genius, however hopefully with time, I can become something remarkable.</p><p name="2950" id="2950" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few weeks earlier, I decided to upload my first video in more than two years and with it came a rushing joy of euphoria and pride. My child-like senses finally returned and I was reminded of how much it all meant to me.</p><p name="aefc" id="aefc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During my absence I had allowed myself to be convinced that I wasn’t good enough. Certainly, there were a lot of factors that contributed to my negative state of mind, however these are things that are completely behind me.</p><p name="23a5" id="23a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No amount of torment is worthy of your attention.</p><p name="9f0a" id="9f0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most importantly, I believe comedy is an integral part of learning to be comfortable with myself and who I am. Deep down inside, I am just doing what makes me happy and it is something I am learning not to feel ashamed of, nor feel any less of myself for it.</p><p name="1c1b" id="1c1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is my mental health strategy and arguably, there is no better cure than art and laughter.</p><figure name="2db6" id="2db6" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"></figure><p name="1e2a" id="1e2a" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--figure"><br></p><p name="aa26" id="aa26" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
