It is a holistic entity that burdens the space around us, mimicking a cerebral catacomb of insecurity and shyness; like that girlfriend you’ve always fought for in your mind, and who clearly was undeserving of the ego triumphing from within. I’ve always loved to write and it’s something that brings in droves, what happiness simply cannot achieve when pattered by a bunch of expectations which eventually spiral into disappointment and arcane silence.</p><p name="18c0" id="18c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sometime over the past few months, I’d made the decision to publish my writing onto some innately serious platforms (whatever that even means). You know, those big players in shiny suits that make us tumble and turn, as if “fatalistic misnomer” were a happy phrase. I’d always wanted to have my words read and cherished, and it was part of the reason why I decided to study journalism some distant years ago.</p><p name="4bb8" id="4bb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wanted to become an embodied influencer of the kind of society that speaks as loudly as it droves; a kind of expert that people come to pay tribute to, and ask for opinion as if words were this century’s commodity forever lavished and divine. Though perhaps ironically, the only people who are truly respected on the internet i.e. worshiped, are those either hate-filled and maniac, or the many varieties of hinterland troll pretending to be real people with lives and soul; a wonderful mix-match of the kind of “divide and conquer” our attention-deprived society has now customarily been shoved into. </p><p name="ce9b" id="ce9b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Note: Lacking of structural integrity.</p><p name="4e43" id="4e43" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I would write incessantly, honing my words with impetuosity, publication was an aspect of the craft that I highly disregarded. I never took it seriously, most likely out of fear, and I suppose I was pursuing other outlets at the time; outlets which best fit my mode of expression at the time. </p><p name="5f72" id="5f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe it was the fear that compelled me, pushing me towards my prime to write about …well, whatever it was others wanted to read.</p><p name="a207" id="a207" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the past few months, I laboured myself in the pursuit for publication. I researched hundreds of different websites, filled spreadsheets full of wonderful article ideas, retrieved half-written drafts from prior centuries, along with all other things that I’m sure freelance writers need to attribute and discuss within their own mind. The process, however inspiring, also made me incredibly depressed.</p><p name="c61b" id="c61b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I spent hours replicating the hive mind “euphoria” that these publications try to splurge, only to realise that this kind of writing doesn’t interest me. I was caught in-between the reality of my dream, and the fact that I did not read any of these publications, let alone with any hint of curiosity. It was not the writing I abhorred. I’m certainly sure these writings are brilliant, however they simply serve no purpose in my life. I just don’t care for other people’s opinions, when I barely have enough time for my own. The problem was that these were the types of publications dishin’ out cash and it a barrier I do not wish to transcend. </p><p name="1779" id="1779" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a way, my attempt at freelance glory was a whole-heartedly disingenuous way of claiming fame, and in no way represented who I was an individual. Maybe part of it has to do with my inability to conform or relate to society. I have always had a severe distrust of others, particularly any forms of authority figures. Perhaps it’s a blessing in disguise. It’s not that I don’t like to read. In a way, I feel like the status and exclusivity of these publications make reading an enigmatic chore, rather than a fun habit to uptake and share with the world at large.</p><p name="96fb" id="96fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Take Medium for example. Most articles are entirely predictable and worst of all, has completely commoditised the process of writing to a point that there’s no remembrance, no cherish; only a disposable, well-repeated titbit of perspective that we are born to forget within a few moments having consumed your fifth slice of truncate apple pie. Rinse, repeat; oh, let’s see what other piece of wisdom we can salvage from that human cesspool of misery that we are all trying to overcome.</p><p name="e71c" id="e71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the rat race at its worst, based on the false assumption that happiness derives solely from information. It’s a cycle which explains the mediocrity of all these writers, all bearing roughly the same amount of followers. On some level, perhaps it signifies the dying art of writing as a conveyance of ideas. Maybe humanity has already moved onto to other forms of media to innovate and pretend that everything is a-okay. </p><p name="7c5a" id="7c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the supple race to rebrand content with your own sticker of self-deprecated pretend, we buy into the lie that what we’re selling is unique and therefore, precisely full of shit: We eat, chew and regurgitate this expectation that life must be unique, and that we must somehow blow minds out of the water as if discovering the next and greatest source of human protein: The human word.</p><p name="e85f" id="e85f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue is that at some point in our lives, we feel like we have an obligation to prove ourselves, rather than simply exist for the sake of existing. We feel this great insecurity, rather, demise, to show that we are all capable with our talents and that we can achieve some kind of mainstream success in our works and beliefs — simply by playing this futile game. We rim to influence the world and explode into a thousand different colours, as if our current spectrum is all that matters and truly must exist for our own success in life.</p><p name="b7fd" id="b7fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fundamentally, we lose who we are as people in this process and it all flurries out into bad segregation. We try and seek audiences to please and shatter, thinking that we are some kind of arbiter in their world. In reality, we are all forgettable symbols to a grey backdrop of meaningless words, why cry more often than they smile. Worst of all, we forget who we were really were writing for all along: That big black thing called our ego.</p><p name="dca3" id="dca3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Something interesting happened recently. My girlfriend discovered an old journal of mine from when I was travelling through Tibet. She decided to read it to me and it reminded me of what it meant to have an audience that matters. You don’t need to write to a crowd of millions, who will inevitably forget who you are within moments. It was just a company of two, lying in bed, listening to my tales as a young 20 year old; a moment we will likely not forget.</p><p name="4444" id="4444" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understandably we all want that dainty thing called “mainstream success” however there is nothing appropriately successful about chasing an image that exists only as a cheesy Hollywood film in our mind.</p><p name="6c4b" id="6c4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, it’s probably just me. I have no designated audience and it’s a facet I find liberating, rather than exhausting. I can now focus on the writing I want to produce, rather than the kind of writing we’ve been brainwashed to believe is best for our self-discovery. </p><p name="e60a" id="e60a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Sit back. Relax. Flip burgers, or something.</p></div></div></section>
