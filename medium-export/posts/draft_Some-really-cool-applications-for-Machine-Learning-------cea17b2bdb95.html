Especially when it comes to things like creating graphs. </p><p name="f0bb" id="f0bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that’s simply part of. the. journey.</p><p name="dc84" id="dc84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose what attracted me to Machine Learning in the first place was the potential with what could be done with it. It was a bit like discovering Programming 2.0. Teaching the computer to develop models with data is absolute genius.</p><p name="5f73" id="5f73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hilariously when I was trying to a build a Japanese-English language engine, it never occurred to me that there could be an easier way to develop translations, other than to simply write a huge rulebook of grammar and inflection. It’s because I didn’t realise that Machine Learning was the answer. </p><p name="9fb9" id="9fb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead I thought learning had to be a highly rigid, manual task — built upon infinite structure. Oh, how I was wrong. </p><p name="9adb" id="9adb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another awesome thing that’s been of great benefit has been my Software Engineering background, which has allowed me to pick up a lot of Machine Learning concepts rather quickly. For example, setting up an Anaconda environment, learning Python and just being able to understand algorithm implementations without worrying about the syntax.</p><p name="93b6" id="93b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where it’s all new/difficult for me has been:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ebb3" id="ebb3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Math (Linear Algebra, Calculus etc.)</li><li name="8ed9" id="8ed9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Statistics (Probability, Gaussian Distributions etc.)</li><li name="0c17" id="0c17" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Algorithms (Gradient Descent, Cost Functions etc.)</li></ul><p name="5c9f" id="5c9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">And it’s this stuff that I’m having to learn from the ground up, and as a result, it’s not as quick for me as simply learning the syntax of a new programming language. Instead, it’s like adopting an entirely new way to think about the world, and that’s cool too, because I’m excited to use this skill to do many amazing things.</p><p name="5240" id="5240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just wait and see folks! This man is serious, and I intend to write a heap of articles about it, so you can see me rise from confused pupil to an even more confused master. </p><p name="5947" id="5947" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In effect, just pretend that I’m a really gross Ash Ketchum in his mid-20s’ who’s struggling to define himself outside of the world of Pokemon. Oh, and I may have a slight crack addiction. </p><h3 name="7186" id="7186" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">My ~~**AWESOME**~~ Cool Ideas List</h3><p name="b648" id="b648" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Regardless, here are a list of some of the applications that I’ve been thinking about building. Oh, and that you might be able to draw inspiration from as well!</p><p name="b4ff" id="b4ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not to mention, I would like to think that some of them are original ideas, and are  therefore applicable to solving some very real problems.</p><p name="614d" id="614d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><h4 name="e363" id="e363" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Create A Self-Documenting Journal Based On Your Online Information</h4><p name="dd3c" id="dd3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">So I thought this was a pretty awesome idea. I have no idea if anyone else is doing this, but essentially it’s based on the premise of sharing and combining data from several of your online sources in order to create and organise your life into an online “journal” which would summarise  your life in analytical terms. </p><p name="a282" id="a282" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the problem with humans is that we fail to maintain perspective. We either think too long into the future or we fail to focus on the now. In essence, this application would remind you of all these things at the right time when needed, based on your own input and interaction with the system. </p><p name="f28d" id="f28d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, you may be feeling depressed because you may have forgotten all the wonderful things you’ve ever achieved in the past, as a result of struggling to solve  a really difficult problem. Well, this application would help provide that perspective to you.</p><p name="989b" id="989b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, it could even be an opportunity for Machine Learning to actually write a complete biography about your life. It would search through all your messages, and for example, concatenate all the childhood stories you’ve ever expressed. Which could then be turned into a chapter within itself etc.</p><p name="66f5" id="66f5" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><h4 name="6761" id="6761" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Pioneer An Open-Source Big Data Foundation</h4><p name="efb9" id="efb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I would say this is arguably the most important thing any Machine Learning enthusiast can ever do.</p><p name="9820" id="9820" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…and the best thing, is that it’s a skill which requires no math or even Machine Learning itself, which perfectly suits me since I come from a strong marketing background. </p><p name="450b" id="450b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the biggest problems in Machine Learning today is the lack of supervised data available to the public. For example, the available of tagged images of Pokemon, in order to be build some kind of perverted Pokemon identifier.</p><p name="8389" id="8389" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And this is important, because data in-effect is what helps spur innovation, not the other way around. You can have the most amazing algorithm, but without any data you’re rendered useless to applying it.</p><p name="0829" id="0829" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe we’ll see is a rise in people founding these types of organisations, which will essentially rely on volunteers to help build these datasets for the sake of fandom. </p><p name="11ce" id="11ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Personally speaking, I intend to focus on two areas which I believe would be relatively easy to setup. Pokemon and Anime. </p><p name="a591" id="a591" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But yeah, it’s also a lot of code (especially trying to figure out how to build an image annotator) but it’s still an important task none-the-less.</p><p name="89ef" id="89ef" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><h4 name="d046" id="d046" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Mental Health Chatbot</h4><p name="2abe" id="2abe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Mental health is an area which is quite dear to me, and which I think Machine Learning via Natural Language Processing could be of great benefit. </p><p name="288a" id="288a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the past I attempted to build an accountability bot to help people with Porn Addiction and while it worked a treat for most people, I think it can be improved upon greatly.</p><p name="31c2" id="31c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this case, it would draw upon the data you inputted in your accountability posting in order to provide recommendations and infer your progress. Pretty neat, huh?</p><p name="cf54" id="cf54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But yeah, what I would focus on is being able to detect hopelessness, because it’s something which is actually easily quantifiable based on sentiment analysis. But yeah, I imagine I would still need a large quantity of supervised data in order to carry out such a project, but that’s cool too!</p><p name="b7ef" id="b7ef" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><h4 name="db1b" id="db1b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Highly Optimised AI Porn Website</h4><p name="92a9" id="92a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This was actually the original idea I had for a Machine Learning application, for a variety of sensible reasons which I won’t go into detail, but yeah, I’ve actually come to realise it’s a terrible idea. </p><p name="d73e" id="d73e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because I was like, “Well, how could you create an ethical porn website?” and essentially it would offer recovery services to people who really needed help, but it was also an awful idea based on a number of equally insensible reasons.</p><p name="8608" id="8608" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’d basically just get addicted to porn and as a former porn addict, is just an awful thing. </p><p name="86d2" id="86d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But still, it would be a great opportunity to build something like an image porn filter, but yeah. It’s simply not possible given my mental state.</p><p name="5550" id="5550" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Actually, there are a whole host of porn-related applications I can think of:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="8fad" id="8fad" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Porn Collection Analyser.</strong> It would use image classification and object recognition in order to sort your porn collection. Again, you would need a lot of supervised data to do this.</li><li name="37b3" id="37b3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Porn Preference Analyser. </strong>It would essentially predict your tastes based on what you liked previously.</li><li name="e098" id="e098" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Fake Chaturbate  Bots. </strong>Essentially you would create fake bots on your webcam stream in order to create the impression that there’s a lot of viewers. </li></ul><p name="bd40" id="bd40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">But yeah, I’m sure there are heaps of different applications related to porn usage and consumption.</p><p name="4d41" id="4d41" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><h4 name="a037" id="a037" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Competitive Analysis</strong></h4><p name="9588" id="9588" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is a huge area where Machine Learning can come into play.</p><p name="132b" id="132b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Essentially it would scrape the websites of your competitors and analyse their blogs and content in order to understand the direction of their marketing, as well as identify future trends in where they’re going.</p><p name="20d6" id="20d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From there, it would then extract features from the content it scrapes in order to perform analysis, just as categorisation in order to determine where your company fits within the competitive landscape.</p><p name="dd44" id="dd44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’m sure there’s more you can do with this, but I also don’t think it’s something I’d be inherently interested in. Although I would certainly consider political analysis, as opposed to something like business analysis.</p></div></div></section><section name="0314" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="c55b" id="c55b" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">So yeah, that’s just a vague brain-dump of ambition, squandered (I actually prefer the term squandled, but apparently it’s not an actual word) into a litany of blah, blah, blah.</p><p name="9b54" id="9b54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coming up next, I want to write about performing your very own Linear Regression on some data I have not yet figured out yet! </p><p name="3c94" id="3c94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Welcome to the future, bby. </p></div></div></section>
