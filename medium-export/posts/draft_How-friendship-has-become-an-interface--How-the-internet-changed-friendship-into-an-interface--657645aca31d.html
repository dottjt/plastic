Quite happily, the internet is a place for information to flourish and ideas to be shared; a global platform for eliminating attrition.</p><p name="a625" id="a625" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With a rudimentary knowledge of Google, anyone can just about locate anything they desire and platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, which have become ubiquitous within most our lives, never has communication become more effortless.</p><p name="be4b" id="be4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was thinking about the kind of people I associate with my life and it occurred to me that our universal idea of friendship has completely changed and evolved, due to the</p><p name="73f0" id="73f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">has completely dissolved into a cesspool of accessibility and in many ways, it’s a beautiful thing.</p><p name="5f0d" id="5f0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the internet, friends come and go like they never existed.</p><p name="3f0d" id="3f0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When someone likes your post, they automatically become your friend for that small moment in time.</p><p name="bfbb" id="bfbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you read someone’s article on their website, it feels as if you’re reading the words of a friend. They are sharing knowledge with you on an intimate level on their own platform.</p><p name="dc1f" id="dc1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the past you would have established authorities such as newspapers, government and radio stations that would be channels of communications for us to understand the world.</p><p name="8a7f" id="8a7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now these are simple relics of the past and with millions of different platforms to channel our own message, ideas of friendship, truth and belief are no longer sacred.</p><p name="7922" id="7922" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On a more fundamental level, I believe it exposes the subjugated meaning of what friendship has become (or perhaps, always was).</p><p name="3848" id="3848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It seems, especially considering where the internet is going, that friendship is now largely a feeling, rather than any kind of integral bond held together by ideas of loyalty or honour.</p><p name="0044" id="0044" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friendship is no longer defined by how long you know someone,</p><p name="7e46" id="7e46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps however, what has really happened, is that the idea of friendship has diversified into new areas where</p><p name="6626" id="6626" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, it almost exposes how superficial humans really are. It’s like our minds can be tricked into believing anything, given how accessible life has truly become.</p><p name="6b11" id="6b11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though arguably, we always were superficial. Merely because we spend so much of our lives on the internet or in-front of a screen, we have become so overwhelmed with this superficiality that we actually believe it is something deep and meaningful.</p><p name="c368" id="c368" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To abstract my point to something a little more tangible, when you think about it, friendship has now become an identifiable interface, rather than a tangible asset.</p><p name="8424" id="8424" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We spend more time identifying with our friends through</p><p name="d53a" id="d53a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Friendship has become an intern</p><p name="9f46" id="9f46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">like they become your friend.

Everyone is presented in the same, non-confronting layout and while you don’t know them, they sure-as-hell look friendly.</p><p name="8c95" id="8c95" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps that’s simply what makes life so beautiful — being ignorant of the fact that it’s just one big holographic experience perpetuated by the emotions that play beautiful sonatas in our mind.</p><p name="473e" id="473e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hardest part to come to terms with however is that some things in life simply cannot be automated to become convenient.</p><p name="b751" id="b751" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose the interesting case is food.
