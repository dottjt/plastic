I can barely string a thought together, and my mind is veiled under a haze of irredeemable contention. However, I also know that if I don’t explore the paralysis seeking my thoughts, I may very well never see the light of day again. Oh, these stupid little fingers, tapping away at the muddy incomprehension repressing my ability to communicate, I assume, so we can achieve some kind of plain intellectual stupor to compliment the ritual drowning of my cardinal sins.</p><p name="566c" id="566c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a lot like being trapped inside a cardboard box; too silly to realise you’re perfectly fine to walk away; too lazy to compute the feint delusions of safety currently peering through the dry, disproportionate mesh. Really, the only thing keeping me awake at this hour is the imagery, the stupid fucking imagery, which is neither real, nor smart: just another obtuse lie to suck on and die, until the box collapses from within and your wisdom is blown away into the meridian summer-set.</p><p name="eb5c" id="eb5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like an impenetrable fear, snaking through the precipice of my veins, I feel vaguely agitated, rather than humbled by my mood. My mind, a bohemian fantasy, is a warehouse of shame, guilt and unidentifiable misery, stockpiling archaic memories with no foreseeable context. It almost feels like there’s something stuck in my throat, choking me into a subtle coma, daring to question my inhabitable function as a human being.</p><p name="b130" id="b130" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alright, I could have just said ‘anxiety’, but that would be lame. Yes, I have become the pretentious beggar, walking a fine line between aristocrat and peasant. I’m anxious because of the deep conflict currently drumming in my heart, beating to the tune of an explosive war being fought within the distance, invariably out-of-sight.</p><p name="2d9c" id="2d9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hell, I don’t know. I honestly wish I did, but I can’t.</p><p name="c71d" id="c71d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m tired of myself. I’m tired of my skin, tired of my inability to curate, tired of these lies which paint so well, that they even deceive the reflection mocking from within. I don’t really know who I am, who I’m writing to, or why I’m still here, but I’m kicking and screaming and it’s the kind of hurt which mesmerises, rather than delegates. Maybe I’m just statistically decomposing into the raw materials my body have come to constitute. A leg here. An arm there. Too sick to cry, too healthy to die. Someone shove me in a glass box and leave me outside on the boulevard near a charity shop; at least I’ve been told you shouldn’t leave your trash out in the street.</p><p name="3b30" id="3b30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe this is superficial, perhaps even keenly vain, however I want to feel beautiful and it’s all I can think about. I don’t know why, but of the wide range of human emotions and feelings I can think of, beauty is the one I want most at this point in time. Not in a physical sense (I literally pay no attention to how I look) however in the sense of feeling, of mastery and perception. I want to feel and see the depth of beauty that runs through my eyes, filling the air with a moist and luscious texture; sensually abrasive to a standard even lust itself cannot adjure.</p><p name="f094" id="f094" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Okay, I certainly feel much better now, but not the kind of ‘better’ that feels conducive to my own well-being. I almost feel like I’ve done that thing where I attach myself to a notion, graceful as it may, only to realise how fragile my commitment has rendered; how silly and ignorant I was to believe that hope could have ever lay in something as simple as feeling.</p><p name="c801" id="c801" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So if not beauty, then what else? Ambition? Suicide? Knowledge? Is it the pursuit or the goal which is crushing me? Am I even capable of leading a healthy, balanced life, or am I just too damned inexperienced to furnish the requirement? It’s shit like this why we live in fear and loathing, incapable of passing judgement without chucking a hissy fit within that dark place brooding like flies within our mind.</p><p name="0e4f" id="0e4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem, if that’s what you’d call it (though I think, a highly inappropriate description) is that I allow myself to become consumed. It doesn’t really matter what it is, how much it costs, or how unabatedly destructive my rein will display, I simply allow myself to get sucked in, with no plans of ever leaving. My emotions, ambitions, pursuits, feelings, beliefs, delusions — all a vile playground for the nausea which seems to entertain me. I focus my attention solely on the depth of thy rabbit hole, to an extent where these activities transpire into an integral part of who I am.</p><p name="3970" id="3970" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To top things off, I firmly identify myself with the ‘craze’ and in my worst moments, feel as if nothing can stop me: not even myself. Sadly, it is a transformation I do not recognise until it is far too late; laid waste to a notion I promised would set me free, only to realise the lunch was laid by a master I may not address. By then, you are already a dead man, hanging crude on to what you thought would bring you happiness, now daft in the blue.</p><p name="a14a" id="a14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, ideas are what give us life. Ideas are what propel us to succeed and become who we are. Without ideas, we side step the humanity, the personality, and charm with which invention has brought us. Though brilliant, ideas are still incapable of creating the kind of trust and confidence which allows us to fulfil our visions; an inherently broken part of who I am, which feels disconnect with the reality absorbing my constituents. I am too conditioned to breathe, too weak to live without abstraction, leaving unattempted, the humble deliberation of my mind.</p><p name="0b5c" id="0b5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The biggest fallacy we make in regard to our own ideas, is that we claim that they allow us to become the best versions of ourselves, or even something ideal, as if we weren’t already pretty snazzy enough. When we start equating ideas to greatness or pride, as a kind of force to be reckoned with, we can begin to falter into the folds and this is probably the problem I have with my life: I am a sucker for narratives and emotions, both healthy and sad. Cake me in the fine exterior of a visual monopoly, so the world can gaze and grow jealous of my dilapidated affair.</p><p name="f657" id="f657" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite my inference however, ideas should not to be worshiped, only to be used as tools for the daily forage we embark. Yet where’s the fun? Where’s the mania? How can one exist without the intensity and excitement that comes with placing a gun to another man’s head, only to blow his brains out before he has the chance to respond? Worship becomes irresistible when we are battling complexity, and the hardest thing is that we personally, can barely recognise the religion we have constructed in our wake, rapidly possessing what morality is left of our deception.</p><p name="5c88" id="5c88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The complexity arises in a number of ways. Often we end up creating so many different and conflicting ideas, that we struggle to maintain perspective over who we are and what we are trying to achieve. Come to think about it, I think I tried to play on my mania while studying code. I would jump between so many different concepts at the same time, that it would end up pushing me further into the rabbit hole, igniting the reproach gnawing away at my responsibility.</p><p name="3ce2" id="3ce2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We lose focus. We lose ourselves and we shudder at the loss of our identity. We learn not to think, only to act, as a response of insecurity against our eternal hopelessness, forever cultivating the sinister in whatever was left of who we are.</p><p name="0b67" id="0b67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, it doesn’t feel like this within the mind of the victim. In fact, everything is happy and rosy. Everything is functioning as intended, because that is what we wanted all along: a nice, coherent narrative, with a lot of laughs, a few too many dilemmas, and a big ‘fuck you’ to the other guy in the room doing better. The natural consequence of this complexity is that we develop insecurity in our lives, to a point where it becomes unmanageable and eventually, unbearable.</p><p name="1a71" id="1a71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s why I sometimes resort to my depression.</p><p name="2b67" id="2b67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To me, when the going gets tough, my depression serves as a place to feel secure and certain about who I am, without assumption or perception of who I should be. Depression is an easy-to-maintain constant, which is relatable, and devoid of the uncanny resemblance of idea — a reasonable method of divest proliferation. There is no worship in depression, only a form of futile anarchy that begins to irk you towards some kind of collective exaggeration.</p><p name="0cdd" id="0cdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depression is like an unpleasant holiday in an unfamiliar place, with a bunch of family members you absolutely detest down to the very chuckle preoccupying their ignorance. Well, what can I say. Family was never my strongest suite.</p><p name="0fdb" id="0fdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having writing this piece, I feel like I have a lot more confidence in myself. I feel as if I am getting somewhere in my mind. Sure, it’s easy to say I’m vulnerable, however I want to give myself a chance to explore again, to develop and reinstate a few, jaunty ideas of my own. Let’s push the idleness aside, and maintain some sort of universal vision, pertaining to the sunken history set before me.</p><p name="e3da" id="e3da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My issue is that I don’t know how to feel excited about life anymore, how to feel inspired without taking it personally, and perhaps even rashly. Who really knows, perhaps life is about sharing and providing autonomy, rather than holding it all to your own.</p><p name="86a4" id="86a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So how do you simplify the monster holding you down? I’m not sure, however I think I maybe onto something. Excellent. I feel much better about myself already. Dripping with clean, almost.</p></div></div></section>
