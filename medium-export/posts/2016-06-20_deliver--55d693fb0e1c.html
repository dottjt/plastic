So here I am, leaking abstraction and brooding on obsession. Winter is upon us.</p><p name="8c57" id="8c57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apparently, this is what it’s like to be mentally stable. Though I’m not quite sure how it makes me feel, because often, it means suppressing my feelings to a point of calm inertia. How satisfying, despite the clear extortion of my trauma I once prized as a holy grail of fine marksmanship. “Shoot the child and rape the mother.” Of course not.</p><p name="5d04" id="5d04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess it feels like standing underneath a lonely tree to protect yourself from the grey clouds and tormenting rain above, beating down around you, demanding what little your imagination has to offer.</p><p name="4942" id="4942" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If there’s one thing you must know, it’s that these words are bullshit. I don’t truly believe that there is anything wrong with me, what with my amazing life partner and my blooming career, yet somewhere in my mind is a grand insemination which bleeds and scatters along a beaten stream — collecting dust and hate as if static were a crime.</p><p name="d12a" id="d12a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The beautiful thing about these emotions is that they turn and sway like a tween couple embracing a moonlit sky, flirting with a premise long heralded as a sin to the crown.</p><p name="cfef" id="cfef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know. It’s just this feeling I have. It’s an old and burdensome feeling, that weighs like a feather, yet tickles like a demon.</p><p name="cb47" id="cb47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all have feelings that no matter how hard we try, simply refuse to dissolve and patter. A lot of memories and feelings from my past are making their way back to my consciousness and I have no idea what, or how, I should proceed. Should I embrace them? Should I continue forward, forgetting all the pain that they once caused?</p><p name="8b0e" id="8b0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even though part of me feels strong, I’m terrified that my sentiment is bordering on arrogance, pretending as if I were greater than these daft emotions, as they caress and tally at the motion within.</p><p name="7855" id="7855" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The funny thing is that according to mental stability, your emotions aren’t an indicator of truth. They are merely there to facilitate your journey, and bring you towards a quiet death, which utterly makes sense if you think about it. The hard part is accepting this truth, and truly embracing this journey as an ultimatum that is not only trying to help you, but is in genuine need of your attention.</p><p name="7bfa" id="7bfa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As you can tell, this is what it’s like to be mentally stable. It’s been like, 15 minutes of vague emotional torment and now I’m completely over it.</p><p name="5ba5" id="5ba5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Here is your man, really to kill.</p></div></div></section>
