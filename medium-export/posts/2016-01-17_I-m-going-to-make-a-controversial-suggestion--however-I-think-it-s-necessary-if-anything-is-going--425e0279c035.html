Most of these feminist rage articles are almost exactly the same and it’s shit like this that has been going on for years and years to no prevail.</p><p name="cf30" id="cf30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It just makes feminists angrier and more justified with their anger, which achieves nothing but to solidify the status quo and establish a kind of pseudo-democracy which eventually turns to extremism. Gee, just take a look at 200 years of American democracy and see what’s actually been achieved. Trump for president? Yep, it’s happening to feminism as well:</p><p name="5f24" id="5f24" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I blocked her.

And should have her vagina revoked.” — Extremism, seriously.</em></strong></p><p name="de3c" id="de3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am going to make the argument that there needs to be empathy for trolls and those less informed. If it’s one thing that feminists do that is entirely unacceptable, it’s that they victim blame and attack others for their views against feminism.</p><p name="1638" id="1638" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, it appeases those already in your camp, however it completely alienates everyone else (potential proponents like myself). To me, this article just comes across as a hate rant, which defeats the purpose of having a reasonable point of view to convince others. To someone who does not know much about feminism, articles like these do not paint a pretty picture of what it’s all about.</p><p name="83dd" id="83dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Put it this way, if you actually believe that feminism is the absolute right way (each to their own), then that basically makes everyone else uninformed and misguided. So why hold it against them?</p><p name="a81d" id="a81d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Attacking people does not hold them accountible. Developing empathy does.</p><p name="cdad" id="cdad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Attacking people doesn’t make others want to change, it just makes them even more angry and justified, as you are doing yourself. It’s a shitty coping mechanism at best. Furthermore, if you believe they can’t change, then you’re missing the point of social activism in the first place. Question why they became trolls in the first place. Did they have shitty parents? Maybe it turns out not all women are so great or equal.</p><p name="166d" id="166d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I once hated feminism because I grew up with a mother who took advantage of men in the worst possible way and treated men as second class citizens. Does that make me a bad person or my mother a bad person? Can I be responsible for the society that brought me up? My views have since changed, however this extremism crap has to end.</p><p name="1d89" id="1d89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your job in promoting feminism is that find out why people are impartial to it and to change it, not to blame or demonise that why. Fear tactics are entirely inappropriate no matter what they aim to achieve and they end up creating a domesticated society that is not trained to think, however to react.</p><p name="bc36" id="bc36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anti-feminist trolls are a reaction. They are not well thought-out group, because they’re merely responding in the same fashion that feminsts are. It’s a vicious cycle.</p><p name="2eb8" id="2eb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It’s destroying debate in the worst possible way.</p></div></div></section>
