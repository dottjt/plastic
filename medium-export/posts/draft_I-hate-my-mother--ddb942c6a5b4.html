They’re</p><p name="fd63" id="fd63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I think about her, it evokes a kind of visceral rage of violent imagery. I often day dream about doing horrible things to her, though I tend to do that with a lot of different people.</p><p name="09e7" id="09e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thinking about our relationship today, any amount of intimacy, love or general sense of family which we may have shared, has completely eroded between us.</p><p name="b0f8" id="b0f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every day she asks me how work was and even till this day, I refuse to give her any details. In fact, she doesn’t even know what I do at work; it makes me uncomfortable to express myself to her.</p><p name="dd48" id="dd48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I do not believe this is a recent invention. It is a slow erosion, through the decisions that hard gradually been made overtime.</p><p name="3c0d" id="3c0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She is very judgemental of me. She uses pessimistic, backhanded reasoning whenever</p><p name="9877" id="9877" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a person, she is unbearable. She has no concept of co-operation; she always believes that she is right. As a result she isolates people. No one will ever be good enough for her.</p><p name="1da8" id="1da8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It reminds me whenever I watch hopeful children with abusive parents on the bus. Even though they’re being abused or shouted at, you can tell they’re still trying to do good. Still trying to be helpful, even though they’re shouted at for their eagerness.</p><p name="91b4" id="91b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually you reach an age where you become cynical, where you realise you’re just being abused.</p><p name="db7f" id="db7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So you fight it. You tell them it’s wrong and oh boy, have I tried to tell her. Of course, it doesn’t work. It’s their rules, their house and you end up suffering from depression and mental illness, just as I have.</p><p name="7915" id="7915" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On a deeper level, I wonder if I ever truly loved her at all.</p><p name="016a" id="016a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It wasn’t until I experienced my first relationship, did I realise what it meant to care. I don’t have that connection with my mother. I don’t want to get her gifts or share any aspect of my life with her. More importantly, I really don’t care for anything she has to say.</p><p name="726e" id="726e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From my own point of view, it was never love that held us together. It was loyalty.</p><p name="3fa8" id="3fa8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did not grow up in a stable environment as a child and I feel like I never had an opportunity to develop a sense of what love meant. It never felt like a loving, cheerful household. It was just me and my mother.</p><p name="233e" id="233e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, I had a father until he left when I was eight. Certainly, I don’t blame him, though clearly my mother was an idiot for getting with him in the first place.</p><p name="e3b9" id="e3b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, I know my mother tried and I know that she loves me dearly.</p><p name="792f" id="792f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However I feel like there’s a wall between us; like a complete lack of communication. In no way does she feel like a mother to me. Almost, like a stranger.</p><p name="2ad8" id="2ad8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t feel like I grew up in a loving household. The only real connections I shared were either out of need or out of pleasure. I was never taught what it meant to have passion, only to sort of exist and transition from one task to another.</p><p name="9a27" id="9a27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is still loyalty that binds us together, though even that is slowly thinning away.</p><p name="f28b" id="f28b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, she hates my girlfriend. In fact, she’s hated all my girlfriends.</p><p name="6422" id="6422" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Currently, she just strings along several men.</p><p name="9556" id="9556" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, her lonely existence revolves around</p><p name="ca7f" id="ca7f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="129d" id="129d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
