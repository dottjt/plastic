Certainly there’s nothing significant of the rustic simmer bleeding from the walls, the flaky seams of semi-dried paint, the slowly eroding grout, the blah, tah, hah.</p><p name="bbac" id="bbac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless, the bathroom was significant in that silent moment of condolence, like a kind of sore reminder of age. As someone who lost their virginity at 20 and with zero experience with women, I suppose I was left most my life dreaming about what being with that perfect girl should be like.</p><p name="3875" id="3875" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had this overdramatised idea that taking a shower with a women was about as intimate as it could get. Both be dripping wet with love, touching and pressing against each other like an intimate array of sporadic musicality.</p><p name="4b0a" id="4b0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was sold on the idea of taking an excessive amount of drugs together, basking in the collective delusion of colours and ideas. I wanted to make out in public and do naughty things. It just seems like the kind of thing that would be perfect.</p><p name="09d4" id="09d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps one of the biggest fantasies was fixated on this idea of going to clubs and having my girlfriend go around and flirt with other guys, only for me to come along and take her away. As you can tell, I felt sorely inadequate with myself.</p><p name="45bd" id="45bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, none of these ideas really work in practice. Making out begins to tastes more-or-less like dried meat after the 3 month mark in the relationship. Holding each other in a tiny shower becomes a battle for the water, like two dogs fig completely destroying any sustained dreams of intimacy.</p><p name="a7ea" id="a7ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Largely my idea of love had been influenced by the music I’d listened to. Cute is what we aim for was pretty much a staple on my 16 year old playlist and as the most hopeless Asian guy you will have ever met, completely mired at the idea of even having a girlfriend in the first place.</p><p name="35bb" id="35bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now that I have matured, I feel a lot happier not to be living in the unrealistic images from my past. While my ideas of love were cute, they were ultimately a destructive part of who I was and</p><p name="668c" id="668c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If it’s one thing I have learnt from my current relationship, it’s that relationship take time and more importantly effort. I remember for the first six months of my current relationship, at least one of us would have an emotional breakdown each time we met.</p><p name="66f0" id="66f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps above all, the one thing I have learnt is that there was ultimately nothing wrong with my ex-girlfriends. They were all wonderful people and even though they had their issues, they were no more than the issues which I have already faced and dealt with in my current relationship.</p><p name="f755" id="f755" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are often our own worst enemy and yet sometimes, it takes a tragedy to truly realise how lucky you truly have it.</p><p name="e744" id="e744" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now some 16 months into my current relationship, I doubt I could be any happier. I think my wonderful girl is perfect just the way she is and I hope we can build together into something more and more special each day.</p><p name="ee24" id="ee24" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
