I’m a sad, lonely, insecure man with a great big hole in my heart. Okay, that’s not true, but I like writing these kinds of stories, because it brings a kind of glamour where the world around you can awe at the impending salacity, drawing you towards knees. </p><p name="17ff" id="17ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, have I told you I have this really quirky talent of being able to use words that I’ve never heard of in my entire life? Seriously, it’s an actual thing. I mean, salacity? I honestly doubt  I have ever even conceived or heard the word in my entire life, yet part of me knew it just felt right. Sure enough, it turns out that the word had the desired effect I hoped. </p><p name="c09a" id="c09a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Salacity: Appealing to or stimulating sexual desire.</p><p name="928f" id="928f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s this spider right in front of me and it’s terrifying. It’s small, but I think it’s one of those prehistoric spiders, that hasn’t evolved due to how verocious it is. It’s weird to think that spiders used to be massive back in the day, sometimes the size of dogs, yet due to natural selection, have become these tiny, relentless little things. </p><p name="a82d" id="a82d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It doesn’t walk, so much that it twitches. It almost produces this effect as if it’s moving at five frames per second, magically appearing and disappearing from it’s own aura.Those are the scary ones, because they become unpredictable. I don’t get spiders. It’s just been walking around the windows in the same pattern for a while, as if attracted to the sunlight. Maybe sunlight makes it happy, makes it feel safe. It’s probably looking for another twitch spiders to have sex with. Twitch sex, twitch orgasm. I guess that’s something I’d pay to watch.</p><p name="6116" id="6116" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can’t help but moan at how pointless these words are in the context of our society. It’s not like I’m trying to explain how the world works, so that millions of children can become smarter, or something. I’m not trying to promote a product, or an idea. Apparently that’s called insanity.</p><p name="89b1" id="89b1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="23f8" id="23f8" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="0c54" id="0c54" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="0b45" id="0b45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">conceived or even been exposed to </p><p name="e681" id="e681" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="c602" id="c602" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"> you know, the scoop, which is virile dramatisation of what is actually going on in my brain. </p><p name="9783" id="9783" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">to dramatise that somewhat vulnerable part of your brain </p></div></div></section>
