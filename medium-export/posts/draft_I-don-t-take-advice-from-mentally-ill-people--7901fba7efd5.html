I believe it is a beautiful thing, to be able to express yourself and have other people read your words. Call it a modern wonder of Western Civilization.</p><p name="9781" id="9781" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To a certain extent however, it’s a tiring formula that reads like an old’s wives’ tale. You know, the struggling millennials who moan on and on about how fucked up everything is and I get it, I’m one of those people too.</p><p name="869f" id="869f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="7c00" id="7c00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The unspoken truth about mental illness is that once you figure it all out in your head, there really is nothing to write about. In fact, it is impossible to describe a lack of mental illness, because calm is just calm. It has no words.</p><p name="6d09" id="6d09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more you learn about mental illness, the more transparent others become with theirs and it’s almost embarrassing to witness people crumble in their own self-inflicted inferno of judgment and bad dialect.</p><p name="71fb" id="71fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You learn to spot schizophrenics from a mile away and subscuquently, avoid them.</p><p name="b9d9" id="b9d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would be foolish to say that I’m perfect with my mental health, however at the same time, I would also claim that I’m much more mature with my perception of the world and letting go of the kinds of crushing anxieties and self-doubts that hold many of us to ransom.</p><p name="509a" id="509a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For starters, I have stopped reading self-help books.</p><p name="aade" id="aade" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, I would like to say they’re a great starting point for those struggling with their own existence. They have taught me fundamental aspects of mental health that I otherwise would have never discovered.</p><p name="7bfe" id="7bfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point in my life journey however, I would largely consider them a waste of time.</p><p name="ea25" id="ea25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real irony about self-help and other more practice methods such as self-awareness, is that they need to become so ingrained</p><p name="2270" id="2270" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem starting out is that we become too aware, too conscious of how we should think, that we actually sabotage ourselves and return to a lot of our bad habits.</p><p name="ac8b" id="ac8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A lot of self-help writing, does not actually address these bad habits, so much that they describe and express their own struggle with their bad habits.</p><p name="2f34" id="2f34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I tend to spend my time focusing on pursuits that I’m passionate about, rather than on my own mental health.</p><p name="6962" id="6962" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">####l35j�tb</p></div></div></section>
