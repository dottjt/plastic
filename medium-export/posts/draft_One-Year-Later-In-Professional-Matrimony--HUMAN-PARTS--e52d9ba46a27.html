You know, cause words n’ stuff. </p><p name="cc5c" id="cc5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started the year having left my retail job of three years, hoping to do something meaningful with my journalism degree. Of course, in the pessimism of ever achieving anything with my talent, I decided to take on a mentally-crippling telemarketing role instead. </p><p name="a49b" id="a49b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The idea was that I would work on my depression website whilst working full-time, allowing me to have a portfolio of writing and professional experiences to then apply for an actual writing position by the end of the year. </p><p name="f324" id="f324" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few friends made it known to me that telemarketing was a brash, in-humane and gruelling task, yet in my pursuit for mental health, I falsely imagined these traits would prove suitably challenging for my mind, creating appropiate material for my depression website: the inelastic hubris of a severely-detached male.  </p><p name="fbd9" id="fbd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sold myself the idea that sales was glamourous; that I could become the next Wolf of Wall Street, chowing down on a fat pay check each week to the glare of my peers. The incentives at the company were amazing, though in retrospect, questionable. I hastily watched all the Jordan Belfort videos I could find and treated sales as a fine art to be honed and appreciated. Of course, the reality of cold-calling hundreds of people each day was far from glamourous and the subtle delusion that crept into my mind was devastating. </p><p name="0653" id="0653" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Favouritism. Rejection. The extremely high turn over; vanished people, like a kind of sick plague sweeping the office. It was perhaps one of the worst places for any single person to work and to suggest anything less than “emotionally scarring” would be a crass imitation of what it means to be human. The role lasted six weeks and put me into a horrible depression lasting more than two months. I never wanted to apply for another job again. </p><p name="9c05" id="9c05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s something hopeless about being a writer. Aside from the non-existent writing positions that require 5+ years experience in corporate fallacy, the next best thing was marketing: something which my degree did not train me for. Actually, I doubt it trained me for anything, other than to reach for the academic stars. </p><p name="177a" id="177a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With enough hustle (apparently outranking hundreds of other potential candidates), I managed to snag a marketing position for a small company, which well… lasted three weeks before I was fired for claims of espionage (a story for another time). Around this time, whilst hastily learning PhotoShop and HTML, in an effort to even vaguely appear relevant, I developed a love for code. </p><p name="8bc5" id="8bc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">JavaScript, C, Haskell, Clojure, Python.</p><p name="401b" id="401b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Code was like a long-lost child to me. It made life sane again and gave me aspirations beyond writing endless descriptions for products without soul. I smeared code so deep  into my skull that I could recite it’s vague necessities, dripping from the carcass of my spiritually-revived brain. I spent (and continue to spend) hours obsessing over the fine details of computer science and it’s just so empowering to understand the low-level details of what makes computers tick.</p><p name="672d" id="672d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To tell you the truth, the real reason I was fired from my markeing position was because I spent too much of my time studying  code at work (in addition to French, which I was obsessed with at the time). </p><p name="a997" id="a997" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So for a second time, as the story goes, I was jobless yet again and in-spite of the challenges that lay before me, I was determined to find an actual writing job. It was mid-2015, my passion was firmly set in writing and I’d already written roughly 70,000 words for my depression website (the same amount of words as contained in a small book). I also had a huge catalogue of experiences in podcasting, YouTube and radio that put others to shame.</p><p name="5978" id="5978" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like an idiot trained to walk on wheels, it occurred to me that I actually had a lot of material to market myself with. In fact, I had more to market myself with than most people and I wasn’t going to allow my silly, hopeless attitude bring me down any further than it already had. </p><p name="70ae" id="70ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I applied for a few positions; positions I was largely unqualified to contribute, yet a few weeks into my search, I managed to secure an interview for the position of “content writer” for a global conferencing firm. Of course, I had no idea it was a global conferencing firm at the time: any hopeless writer applies for just about every single creative position online as humanly possible, hoping only for the damn best.</p><p name="45bf" id="45bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At first I wasn’t going to attend the interview. </p><p name="cc42" id="cc42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Their office was located in the an awkward position relative to where I hoped  to rent and the idea of becoming a “content writer” didn’t seem so glamourous. In the end, my girlfriend convinced me to go and I absolutely killed the interview. The guy behind the table liked me and I was almost 100% certain I would be working in this mysterious, unknown company. </p><p name="252e" id="252e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I returned to the office a few days later to complete their writing test and the position was mine a few days later. In many ways, writing is  a confident breeze I just pick up and splash at a page; it is an effortless task that my brain loves to pick at. There’s nothing more exciting than visualising ideas come to life; an extension of my love for code. </p><p name="ea57" id="ea57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve now been at this company for six months now and the lousy title of “content writer” actually turned out to be “PR/Communications Manager”. In fact, as part of my job, I get to travel to major cities across the country to help manage conferences and interview big suits. Admittedly, it sounds a lot more alluring than it actually is, however I cannot understate how grateful I am to be where I am.</p><p name="0906" id="0906" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To even be in a position where I am at liberty to write for an income, is a privilege most people do not even brace. In fact, I’m grateful to even have a full-time job that doesn’t revolve around sales, though certainly, it is something I worked incredibly hard to make happen. </p><p name="6626" id="6626" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would write one article each day for my depression website, which is hard enough when you’re working full-time in highly stressful circumstances. I would find every opportunity I could to write (public transport was my blessing) and with each post more than 1,000 words long — it would take about 3–4 hours to write and publish each day. </p><p name="389b" id="389b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then of course, there were days where my depression got so bad that I would take weeks off to focus on other things, however I always made sure to have a back catalogue of articles to publish under these circumstances. Soon my habit developed into complex hand pains, to a point I had to take a break from writing. </p><p name="01fe" id="01fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could not give up. I knew I needed this portfolio and I was not going to denying myself the opportunity to do something better with my life. In the process, it taught me the value of hard work and it’s something I have carried with me since; the unrelentless grind that comes with having dreams of a brighter future. </p><p name="0d13" id="0d13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, this year of success could not have been possible if it weren’t for my lovely girlfriend: my muse and wonderful darling who inspired me through life’s hard times and made me realise my own potential in this large, scary world. </p><p name="1221" id="1221" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As of January 1st 2016, our relationship reached the 18 month mark and it is truly remarkable to have someone that close and special in your life, whether it be one day or sixity years. </p><p name="7bd2" id="7bd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe 2015 will be seen as a year of struggle. A struggle for financial independence; a struggle to make my mark on this world. It was a struggle of self-discovery, focus and direction (and a successful one at that). I now know exactly what I want in life, both in my career and my relationship.  </p><p name="9372" id="9372" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have my coding to look forward to. My freelance writing career which I am hoping to start soon. My lovely girlfriend. My YouTube channel. So much for me to sink my teeth into and grow as an individual. </p><p name="c118" id="c118" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Along the way I lost a few close friends and yes, 2015 was not without it’s lows, however to see how far I have come as an individual is tremendous. I stopped relying on Tumblr for emotional support and a lot of my old demons left me as well. </p><p name="a3b8" id="a3b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2016 will be a beautiful year. </p><p name="d3a4" id="d3a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I know it, because I’m sitting next to my girlfriend in her office and she has the most beautiful smile I’ve ever seen. </p></div></div></section>
