In a state of perpetual limbo… blah, blah, wah, or whatever pretentious bullshit my mind has decided to churn today.</p><p name="e1d1" id="e1d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wouldn’t quite describe myself as a drifter. I’m much more like a baby seal, repeatedly bashed and lured away into the snow by a desperate father of three, as I’m sure, out of necessity rather than hostility. My corpse, processed into a delicious stew for a somewhat starved and desperate tribe, will be enjoyed by many, while my teeth, ripped apart from their decaying confection, will be made into trinkets for the elders and children.</p><p name="3177" id="3177" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though seriously, maybe next time, if you’re not too busy engaging in your own excessive male aggression, if you could, like maybe, just ask me to make my way into that giant loathsome pot of yours, then maybe, just maybe, that would be pretty great, yeah? You know, rather than make me suffer for my inability to wield an AK-47, what with these small paupers of mind; useless against the world’s ethnic man in these wild, unremise parts of town.</p><p name="a5cc" id="a5cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, my poor seal head, now broken and shattered against the permafrost, attached and slewn to an excruciating pain beyond words, is seemingly inconsequential to the fear fast approaching my soon-to-be immediate death. How I managed to survive the decapitation, I cannot be sure, however nothing can prepare you for the ensuing disappointment of realising that there is nothing you can do, but scream and squalor, as if barely making it to adulthood wasn’t ravishing enough.</p><p name="4c50" id="4c50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My spinal chord, a humble reminder of the fatality our consequences must endure, is bleeding from the tendons and damaged without love. If only I had gone fishing instead, perhaps even resisting my temptation to live, would I not be stuck in this dark and endless nightmare, shoved around in a sack bearing resemblance to very womb I was born. Oh, what little it matters now, as I pray to my baby seal god for one final time, begging for forgiveness, before perishing into the wind as another biological function performing its daily contribution to society.</p><p name="43fd" id="43fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though before my final moments, as I’m dragged away into a boat constructed from leaky abstractions, my soul subsides its petty chalice to the gods above, reminded of how precious life can be…. the complex thoughts of a baby seal, barely six months old.</p><p name="b383" id="b383" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hardest, perhaps most counter-intuitive part of recovering from my mental illness, is the complete rejection of hope I must constantly survey within my own mind. Don’t look up. Don’t look down. Think with restraint. Calm. Remaining. Wish for the best; if only the worst may follow.</p><p name="bce5" id="bce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My misery steeps from the constant mania I endure; a state of mind intricately hijacked by flares and wizards, corrupting what little is left of my ability to respond. Those dainty goals and aspirations placed delicately on a pedestal of great proportion, erected some 50 metres above the air in the form of a statue; built from the foundations of pure, unadulterated gold.</p><p name="1b81" id="1b81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Worship thy statue. Give it your gold. Give it your reason. Build it until it destroys you, and destroys you, and destroys you, and destroys you, and destroys you, and destroys you, again, and again, and again. Build it until you show care, which as we all know, is more fatal than pleading with your rapist for a more ‘gentle’ experience, as he ties you to bed in a flurry of reverence and uncertainty.</p><p name="d85c" id="d85c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wouldn’t call it obsession, so much as I would describe it as benign obligation; a state of mind my brain has been taught to respect. In the subtle nature of this disease, you are firmly hidden from the exposure of this obligation, even though you can visibly see the chains dangling from your own neglected sensibilities, remaining as disorganised as the day they were first purchased. You want to live, but you do not know how. A fair trial, they said. The judge is a crook.</p><p name="86a5" id="86a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think humans have a lot more in common with statues, than they do with their peers. Despite our human-like emotions, beliefs and perceptions of the world, when you look deep enough into the void we all carry in our hearts, you’ll see nothing more than these these rigid structures, scattered for miles on end, which have been erected without consent, knowledge or forethought. Consumeristic Totem Animals for the morbidly non-spiritual: what could possibly go wrong?</p><p name="d848" id="d848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, everyone is building their own set of statues nowadays, so where are yours? It’s the allure of the high-life that draws you in, because as always, in the feint struggle of perception brooding within your mind, part of you feels obliged to build your statue higher, bigger and better, than the statues of those around you. It’s just what humans do, or rather, have always known to do. We build, we ignore and then we destroy, either willingly or through death. Of course, most of us become so oblivious to our own destruction, that we fail to develop any kind of filter to the madness wreaking within.</p><p name="5eb7" id="5eb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My illness, though dire, is not a bad thing. It allows me to prevent the building, the destruction and the ignorance, and at the very least, precede the sorrow sundering within my own insemination. You want those millions, but ain’t got them. Sorry man, you just don’t have what it takes.</p><p name="b002" id="b002" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m still unaware if my mania is a cycle of elation and depression, or a constant error on my part. While I know a lot about my illness, it is a constant progression of trial and error, blindly suffocating me with both hands. Back into the shoes of depression, and this time, let’s try something new. I think I’ve gotten better, though who really knows. It’s just a circus. It’s a fucking circus and I am the ringmaster, coked on amphetamine and bath salts.</p><p name="4aed" id="4aed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The prospect of stepping outside and exploring my mind again somewhat terrifies me. My depression keeps me safe. It is a place of vantage that allows me to maintain my composure and avoid getting too carried away with my silly thoughts. Better to be sad than be dead. Actually, why not have both?</p><p name="ab51" id="ab51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The problem is that the mind is this harsh duality, constantly seeking pleasure from the pain. Usually I would rely on my mania to get myself out of depression, however it’s a trap I’m hoping to avoid. In a sense, my depression is like a withdrawal from my mania. I almost need my depression to function, at least for the time being, until I can find the courage to explore again. Perhaps I’ll wait it out this time. Waiting. Dreaming. A sort of non-committal state-of-mind that I’m sure my parents would be proud of.</p><p name="283a" id="283a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My studies have largely propelled my mania. I spend so much time learning about algorithms and computer code that it forces me into a kind of boxed world-view perception of what it means to be alive. I become ignorant. I cease worrying. I bastardise and suffocate my humanity, tranquilising my very ability to respond in pursuit of the statue determining my status and self-worth.</p><p name="dd4d" id="dd4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I force myself to pretend, to shape, to mimic; fancy as it goes, to brand my obsession as something okay. I construe the world around me into one big commitment, as if my sore life would depend on it, without question or possibility.</p><p name="52ab" id="52ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even though I can vaguely recognise the hysteria from within the corner of my eye, what can one actually do against this behemoth of haste? How may one help themselves with only a shotgun and a packet of gum? It’s like a harsh mirror that bluffs its own interrogation. I mean, who knows what my mind is really trying to tell me?</p><p name="0c08" id="0c08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh wait, my statue. I should probably tend to my statue.</p><p name="5c87" id="5c87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through this cycle of forced recreation, we develop newer and greater insecurities, which allow us to complete this cycle of depression and elation. We seek new fears. The world around us blends into a kind of tense and incomplete harmony, held together by false hopes and deceit. Incapable of misery, bandaged to oblivion, the impenetrable fortress desires no claim, only authority. It is what drives you to seek and pretend.</p><p name="3e28" id="3e28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is commitment without word. It is stringent requirement, disguised impertinently as harmless crack. It owns you and you pray. You breathe the air around you with a slight remorse that cowers and lies, where did I go so wrong? Is the diagnosis fatal? Will somebody help me? Oh, for you have just lived, and not for one second were you even vaguely concerned with your own well-being. How could you? Are my features not enough?</p><p name="07dc" id="07dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, my circumstances have also played a large part in my decline. My mother, that frugal necessity, sapped any traditional sense of security or self-love from my prying eyes, that home is thought to provide. I feel constantly threatened and belittled by my own mother. Shoved. Prodded. In a sense, my mania has allowed me to understand and push myself, without tearing my hair out and abusing the people around me. It is protection, not from depression, but from the line manics surrounding me, grabbing and spoiling my care.</p><p name="ccd6" id="ccd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would describe vulnerability as a state of being forced to reject what little is left of your will to live, as an unfortunate side-effect to keep living. Central planning at it’s worst. Come to daddy, little child. Allow me to bait you, where you’ll spend the rest of your life toiling away at the few preconceived notions of what it means to be normal.</p><p name="0b76" id="0b76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, balance is a mystery which perplexes us all, driven by an immediate fear of unwilling senselessness; drawn without calamity or notion. I guess it’s like suffering from a perpetual identity crisis, where your only choice is to revel yourself within the mania brewing within, if only to forget the identity you adamantly abhor.</p><p name="a91a" id="a91a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depression is what allows you to see the mania for what it is. It is like a friend who beats you and kicks you down for your own protection; a friend who smashes your head in, proving what humility you have left to communicate with nature. Baby seal. I won’t let you die.</p><p name="5a39" id="5a39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also worry the extent to which optimism and happiness contribute towards my mania. I even worry that these writings may even play a role, though I guess writing in general has always managed to calm me down. Of course, fearing too much may also develop mania, and come to think about it, this kind of rumination is also probably contributing towards my mania, which is why it feels like I’m on a suicide mission.</p><p name="f981" id="f981" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How best to control the mania? I’m not sure. It seems to be a constant battle that is self-defeating and quaint, however I also believe I have gotten much better with myself.</p><p name="59f5" id="59f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the end, it’s always been my lack of perspective which has resulted in my tripping over, largely due to my inability to remember. I literally forget everything I think, feel and squander, and along with it, the accrued wisdom which allows me to see with clear eyes. I forget how destructive I can be as a person, as well as how beautiful and kind I can be.</p><p name="e83c" id="e83c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I assume, almost cowardly, that life is a simple snapshot of the dismal coping mechanisms holding me together internally. By that sense, my depression is a form of a safety, as it is a mechanism to comprehend and understand myself. Though I have an amazing partner, who is there with me 100% of the way, sometimes her support is not enough.</p><p name="bd76" id="bd76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps you need to be mad to see through the madness; insane to feel your own touch, telling you to sleep, when demons lurk within your own dreams.</p><p name="4d19" id="4d19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’m way too exhausted for this. It’s 8:23AM and I’ve been writing since 7.</p></div></div></section>
