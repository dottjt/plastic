I mean, I write stuff, but I just don’t publish it. Maybe I hate myself that much. Okay, I don’t hate myself entirely, however this is certainly one of those moments where I can feel the literal misery, trickling down my forehead, onto the floor and away with my soul.</p><p name="db27" id="db27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a tremendous amount of guilt that runs through my bones and it is something I have no control over. I can’t help the fact that I completely fucked up my first relationship. I can’t help the fact that I have an abusive mother who I effectively decided to disown, not one week ago. She pleaded for me to stay, however I couldn’t handle the stress anymore and so I left.</p><p name="89e2" id="89e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would like to think that I have acknowledged my wrong doing in these matters, it’s just that I often fail to forgive myself, to live, to breathe, without the worry or stress of the burden currently lurking in my existence. I don’t believe I deserve anything, however at the very least, I owe it to myself to smile. You know, pretend everything is okay, until it all comes crashing down, begging me for its fatal attention.</p><p name="18cc" id="18cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, unfortunately, I am not smiling.</p><p name="f809" id="f809" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhere deep inside me, is a child who is dying for affection; clawing at the seams for some kind of unrecognised approval. Of course, what you may not have noticed is that this child is dead; clad so thick in stale blood that the whole scene reeks of tame and misfortune; a sure reminder of my futile attempts, so bloody futile, to resuscitate the fucking thing in a hapless foreplay, to an eventual burial which no one shall attend.</p><p name="ab0d" id="ab0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s nothing pretty about a decomposing corpse, covered so deep in shame that it shines with radial deception. It sure does shine, however it’s not pretty and I would refrain from taking pictures. Please, stop masturbating to my corpse.</p><p name="8f83" id="8f83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to talk about guilt because it’s something which inflicts me like a grey shard of ice, piercing through my lungs and ripping through my jaw, somewhat indefinitely. Despite the crass metaphor, I can really feel it. Not as a feeling of beauty or power, however as a kind of sunken dilapidation that encapsulates my life and swallows it whole. Welcome to the jungle — a vital evolution of life.</p><p name="7757" id="7757" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Guilt is like my lonely cousin I don’t quite love enough to invite over to dinner on Sundays. I really wish it would fuck off and die, but he’s my cousin, and so occasionally we find ourselves at the nearest family funeral, discussing dinner politics and bukkake.</p><p name="083f" id="083f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though, that’s really the problem. If I just forgave the poor thing we wouldn’t be having all this trouble and man, my nephews would get it on like the uncle I deserve. Letting go is always the first step towards some kind of coherence and it is a step I’m currently able to take. So fuck it. Dinner politics and bukkake, here I come.</p><p name="df72" id="df72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps I don’t want you to understand what it’s like to feel my guilt; this real, though clearly undefined horror which eats away at me and taunts me with no resolution in mind. I would like to think I’m getting better, though “better” is more of duration nowadays, rather than a quality. The better is fleeting, a silly error to amend, though what can I say. It’s just who I am.</p><p name="cd32" id="cd32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like the good times. The good times are what keep me above water, so-to-speak and it is a kind of inspiration which draws and collapses, like a bridge crumbling under its own faulty foundations. Better luck next time Cracker Jack. Give me the keys and I’ll lock up shop for tonight.</p><p name="95a0" id="95a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In spite of my dysfunction, that does not mean I am incapable. When I have focus, I am truly brilliant. Not in the sense of a giant fucking star, shining keen above a totalitarian sky, but like a kind of hidden ember among the flames, existing without the vulnerability of sight or wind. A positive form of suffocation.</p><p name="3222" id="3222" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know what initiatives there are to hide, but it seems amenable to sink this ugly side of my personality; a dark exterior which feeds off the very fabrication my mind has perfected oh, so well.</p><p name="153c" id="153c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the first time I have enjoyed writing in a long time and to enjoy myself with the talent I associate with most just… feels good.</p><p name="387c" id="387c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, I have decided to communicate with my insecurity directly, as if that’s going to achieve anything. I know it’s a stupid, utterly foolish thing to do, however someone has to play the pipes for this short piper.</p><p name="ac84" id="ac84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m afraid. Not terrified, just afraid. When you lose yourself, you really are lost and when your mind is so convinced that it must die, you go along with the narrative until you realise it’s just one stupid fucking lie, only then to realise that there is nothing left in the bag, only the emptiness itself which you destroyed to ‘Keep up with the Kardashians’.</p><p name="601e" id="601e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Intelligence, like any tool, will be used to deceive and collude and while it is a difficult premise to battle, archaic consummation will always point to complete failure and it is a cycle I thank dearly. Oh, to hell with it.</p><p name="594a" id="594a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s fair to say that I can be good. I can have self-control. I can control how I feel, or rather, allow nature and ‘reason’ to do its thing. If it’s one thing that I should be grateful for, it’s my self-awareness as an individual; that thing which allows me to recognise my own gargantuan flaws as a human being, so I can lunge towards a weak effort to change them.</p><p name="ce5d" id="ce5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am insecure. I battle my own self-image on a daily basis and on good days, it disappears into the abyss. I simply accept myself for who I am and the judge in my mind is forgiven, though never truly discarded.</p><p name="3d36" id="3d36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coping mechanisms are a lot like dormant volcanos. One day they’re there. Other days they destroy the world and all you’re left with are a bunch of mummified corpses laid thick in primordial ash.</p><p name="256f" id="256f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The good news is that I am getting better. Well, much worse, but eventually better again. I can live months at a time without relapsing into my disastrous spells, usually followed by months of complete agony beyond words. The fun is rare, but it’s also a lot more common than I deserve.</p><p name="3dba" id="3dba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m currently writing a mental health guide. I know, me, writing a fucking mental health guide. I don’t really know exactly what I’m trying to prove, however I know it’s something I have to do. It’s like I understand what’s going on in my head; I just find it hard to distinguish between what is real and what is not. Demons, you truly love to fly.</p><p name="d8c0" id="d8c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe it’s the guilt speaking. On a positive note, it’s a concise, relatable guide that I’m roughly 11,000 words into, which is nice, I suppose. It helps that I’m writing it while depressed half of the time, which means there’s a certain air of empathy to it. I hope it can help others, though it will be years away before it ever sees the day of light. Certainly not until I get my own problems sorted out.</p><p name="45d3" id="45d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I think about it, I have a very difficult time working through my problems. While I can literally have all the answers to my misery, right there, in my hands, ready to go, all I have to do is wake up the next morning and witness the complete abomination of my personality, as if hit by a hurricane, washed away into cheap mouthwash and weatherboard debris, now floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p name="43d2" id="43d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mind is so fleeting, so inconsistent, that it simply corrodes into a feint layer on the surface, making tough meat out of the fool within me. One moment I’ll be hung up on my past, next moment realising how much I despise my own mother, and it’s like each little pass-around will entice me just enough to tickle the fornicated despair, destroying my insides with no remorse.</p><p name="9903" id="9903" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I really don’t give myself enough credit. I have achieved an extraordinary amount with my mental health over the past year and I’ve truly transitioned into becoming a functioning adult. Yes, I’m fucked in the head; but I also work a lot harder than anyone else, so I can find the time to at least approach my dysfunction without it completely destroying my life.</p><p name="ecf0" id="ecf0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I need to remember that I’m not a bad person, nor a particularly good person. I have positive traits, just as I have negative traits, however I’m not toxic. Toxic is a self-perception that comes from your own beliefs and perceptions, not from self-described qualities.</p><p name="7631" id="7631" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the inside, I can feel myself shouting into a deep, empty chasm. My fingers are ripping at the paper walls and yet the more I discover, through the chap shop of my dreams, the more I flounder at the infinite layers of pain which never cease to tease and transpire. It hurts, but eventually you realise you need to stop.</p><p name="994c" id="994c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to get better, and I know I will. I know I can do it. I’ve done it before and it was the best feeling in the whole damn world. When you fail to worry and conspire, you begin to see the world as it is and it shines. It truly shines.</p><p name="1717" id="1717" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two months. You lasted two months before the shit-train completely broke down and shattered all over the bloody carpet. Truth is, I want to cry. I want to cry and breakdown into a little ball of misery, however I am above that. I have a task to do and I value my mental health.</p><p name="6d98" id="6d98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hasn’t helped that my roommate peer pressured me to down those Irish Car Bombs earlier. Rest sweet child.</p><p name="8813" id="8813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You have an amazing, loving girlfriend and an alcoholic roommate who loves you more than anything in the whole world. You can do better, though I have to do better for me.</p><p name="7112" id="7112" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">No one else.</p></div></div></section>
