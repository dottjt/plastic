Tizz-a-tizz. Whip-weeeeee. Unholy translucent fucking chime, intoxicating daisies with the gossip of Mother Queens’ two-part sparkle n’ dazzle. Ta-da! Industrial wafers of concatenation tally themselves at the throne, splurge n’ excess, trickle n’ pore. Over-managed signatures of quaint-sully ooze from the waxy greed mucking ah’ dime from the low hanging fruit ol’ Johnny boy promised us.</p><p name="51ac" id="51ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Promise you shall. Promise you must.</p><p name="d739" id="d739" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Begging mercy for forgiveness, the winter tease is but a cold reminder of the down-trodden collaborations our fathers warned us never to ignore. The thick breeze approaches and falters like a dead dog, crushing the remainder into its place. Divide and conquer. Lovely lovely, lovely lovely. You do have quite a kick, don’t you?</p><p name="6752" id="6752" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The insects crawl all over the subdued nature of an unrecognisable carcass. Venezuela style, crippled at the core, attracted to the death that reeks like broken limbs from a medieval heartbreak. “She’ll return from the garrison, you fuck. Kisses and Circles and great big delusions upon you, sir.”</p><p name="ede9" id="ede9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ever-surreal dust gathers upon the charred cleanliness of this new era, a bee for a bee, a crate for a crate, resonating haplessly amongst the recommendations of a few… and in a pack of surrounding grey, young larvae smoke a pouch of lucky golds, chuffing alive at the slither of their unguiding conscious.</p><p name="fff9" id="fff9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Drooling sweet misery corrupting their souls.</p><p name="6a27" id="6a27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The unrelentless ringing provides harmony and death for an unworthy few, suffocating the rest into a blind hysteria. The hand is an ever-quiet reminder that god himself has no choice over the misery which thy commands, picks the bastards by the finger and flings them a fat chummy.</p><p name="13a3" id="13a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And. They. All. Fall. Down.</p><p name="90d3" id="90d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, such the fright of Mr. Alright; southern earth is calling.</p><p name="960e" id="960e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eat the fuckers alive. Bees will be bees and hands will be hands. Religion is our orange institution, brainwashing authority to the guilt of the needy. Tradition sour as wet apples, fermenting in the deep ink engraved across our skulls. The perforation, a god-like scribe, singles itself out without a single second to spare. Taxing and dunking and tiling and forcing. The schema is bright and alive.</p><p name="1abb" id="1abb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Circular animals. Rigid squares. Your meal has been served and so drink until you can fly. The paper-thin paper is a cause for concern… for the pen no likey; antennae galore. Put the message down, we will, we will. Nothing comes better than the cerebral propagation bastardising the outlier of expensive, charming literature.</p><p name="d6bd" id="d6bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, quite the charmer, they say. Forever charming. Keeping his cues within a tight bound, never to be touched or prodded. Attack! Attack! The creatures churn and discard what’s left into the corner, moulding away in a fiery outburst of inconsequential recollection. The bees are coming. The bees are dead.</p><p name="0d8a" id="0d8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will no longer pretend that this piece has anything to do with bees.</p><p name="8cfe" id="8cfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather, this attempt at incoherence is just another fucking shameful mess of literature, completely oblivious to itself, which quite frankly could give two-fucks about the topic at hand. It has NO respect. It has NO pretend. There is NO fucking narrative, which has prompted me to continue pumping out this GARBAGE. So here I am, apologising to myself for something which should have been blatantly obvious and yet, somehow, could not be lyrically coerced.</p><p name="9660" id="9660" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have suckled away at the teat of individualism for far too long, and so here I stand, ignorant in my perpetuation of the crumbling foundations we’ve all come to expect. Amateur attitudes, we present my words.</p><p name="c9d0" id="c9d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">There’s your word-count, asshole.</p></div></div></section>
