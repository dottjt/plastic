The reason I’m experiencing this craving is because I’m in the process of finding a new job, which means spending an excessive amount of time in limbo completing tasks which seem utterly intangible, though inconsequentially profound.</p><p name="9f07" id="9f07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…shaking the hands of budding recruiters, repeating my name for the nth time. Oh look. Here arrives my water in an oddly shaped glass, as has been apparent by the somewhat corporate, though mature language of the office.</p><p name="0068" id="0068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For whatever reason my brain sees this as an excuse to extrapolate the worst aspects of ME. Not only gearing my thoughts towards complete self-mutilation, however draining the apathy directly from my skull and moulding it into a viable solution for consumption. You see, when you’re no longer in the presence of others, you no longer become accountable. You no longer worry about leaving your needles in a bad place or taking your business to the park.</p><p name="6dc7" id="6dc7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Please, please, please. I beg you to discard of the sharp reminder making dull edges of a frictionless beat.”</p><p name="c757" id="c757" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather, your mind becomes a sinister playground to commit murder and sell sensibility, cheap on the perennial dollar. Apparently, there simply is no competition to the harping madness, and unfortunately, the judge has been grated and sliced into a non-sensical crime story gone slinky on a harmless charade. Mince meat, anyone?</p><p name="be32" id="be32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel like ripping my eyes out and scraping them along an extended carpet of broken glass, as if the undeliverable pain might serve as a suitable distraction from the shouting match currently raging in my mind. My pre-mature neurons are pulsating like an American suffering from a prolonged heart attack, all in dramatic time, and fashion.</p><p name="be31" id="be31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this stage of the game, I feel as if I’ve already lost. I don’t feel in-control of myself and I feel like it’s only a matter of time before I give in, standing thin on a broken scale that can never veer right. I’ve been edging all day, though not quite committing. Maybe it’s a sign there’s something stronger, brooding along the angular funnel of my veins.</p><p name="85ed" id="85ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It doesn’t take a genius to know that it’ll feel amazing. Like an effervescent lie surging through the rumours of fantasy, my mind will cloud into a temporal nirvana, recreating heaven as if imagination were the only limitation to my immortality.</p><p name="336e" id="336e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, I’m also quite weary of my feelings and emotions as an outlet for self-abuse and quandry. Yes, I’m wholly aware these ‘feel things’ cannot be trusted. Yet at the same time, I maintain an understanding that there is no premise to trust. I mean, it’s been months since I last gave in. How bad could it possibly be?</p><p name="f5d9" id="f5d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The answer, I think, is utterly terrible. I will become a monster with tendrils. Shrieking from my heart with an absolute grey, my gaze will devour what little colour this world has to share. Despite my wants and needs, I’m reminded that the outcome will be horrible beyond depression, even though I’m not quite sure why, how or where this great disaster will find itself lurking.</p><p name="8e37" id="8e37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the problem with progress. When you progress, you place yourself in an unidentifiable position and you become scared. Losing, then becomes an attractive option, because to admit familiarity is to admit your imperfect projection of reality. Yet to continue forward, if ever such insanity were to be suggested to one fool, would be to is to reinvent yourself in ways that even god herself wouldn’t have known possible.</p><p name="e30f" id="e30f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess writing about the whole experience has been therapeutic for me. I don’t know why, but it’s working. Maybe it’s just a distraction to keep my mind vulnerable and on haste, prodding at my thoughts with a keen pretension.</p><p name="23d3" id="23d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All that ambition, all that purpose, finally dissolved into a chase of despair and faulty premonition. Gosh, I really do like that phrase. While I am free from torment tonight, it would be silly to claim victory, particularly amongst this minefield of hearty nomenclature, which can sometimes amount to diffusing a bomb whilst wildly jumping on-top of it.</p><p name="ac37" id="ac37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">You know, I’m a pretty good writer. Maybe that’s something to be proud of.</p></div></div></section>
