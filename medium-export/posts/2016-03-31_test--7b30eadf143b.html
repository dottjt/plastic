I did this huge workout yesterday and my mind has been grinding all day, as if the cogs running this joint had become rusted and disjoint. Despite the physical nature of exercise, my exhaustion has been largely mental. I haven’t been able to concentrate as much as I’d like to, which has affected my ability to study and process information — a basic staple of what it means to be Julius Reade.</p><p name="3ca7" id="3ca7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The good news is that I’ve managed to deal with this perceived limitation without overreacting, as well as maintain perspective on the whole thing. I took a step back in my mind, breathed in and smiled. I cannot even tell you how much of a godsend self-awareness has been for my mental health: for the first time in a long time, I finally feel as if I have a level of control over myself.</p><p name="2ec1" id="2ec1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, I have been in this position before, of course, somehow throwing it all away with my hubris, time and time again, however I’d like to think I’m a bit wiser this time. Each time I learn a little more about myself and I become reminded of who I am: a deeply vulnerable man who needs routine and an open mind on sensitive issues.</p><p name="b78a" id="b78a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m very happy with the changes I have made in my life. Cutting mum out. Learning to control myself. Living a healthy, productive life. Seeking responsibility and long term ambition. I no longer get distracted by the silly things in life, like the attention of other women in public. I no longer allow my mind to be captured by ideas of haste and I’ve certainly reduced my violent, often conflicting daydreams. I constantly engage in meditation, whether it be at work, or sitting outside waiting for the train.</p><p name="d017" id="d017" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The biggest thing is for me is to slow down, recuperate and accept. No matter what I’m doing, I’ll make an effort to just slow down what I’m doing, think about who I am and adopt a new perspective. I’ll focus on the small details at the train station, like the roof lining or edging in the tiles; all the things that we don’t notice because of all the goals and obligations we’ve become slaves to.</p><p name="617d" id="617d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Observe myself. Become aware. Mental illness doesn’t have to be difficult, however you have to be calm and smart about it. We can’t all be superman, but that’s okay. I would rather be normal for the rest of my life, rather than superman for a few days, followed by complete debilitation for weeks at a time.</p><p name="bd3d" id="bd3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Acknowledge boundaries and working with them. I think so too.</p><p name="bbd1" id="bbd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d like to take the time to be grateful for a few things in my life. I’m grateful to have a job which pays me to do what I love doing and furthermore, what I’m good at. I’m grateful to have the opportunity to learn and grow as an individual. I’m grateful for my brain, my functioning brain, which allows me to make decisions and experience life. I’m grateful for my friends and for my girlfriend, who provides me with more love than I can possibly appreciate.</p><p name="9f73" id="9f73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’m grateful to be writing these words; expressing who I am, without fear and worry of reprise. Time for an early sleep, I think!</p></div></div></section>
