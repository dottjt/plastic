A tale of self-deceit that runs so far down my bloodstream that it bursts and tumbles, splashing violently into a tub of red. </p><p name="33e9" id="33e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know why I’m writing this. Well, I think I do, but I’m sure that’s just my insecurity speaking. Yep, it’s definitely my insecurity speaking. I guess I want to explain why I do the things I do. Maybe it’s important for you to know why I do it, assuming I’m correct, which changes almost constantly. </p><p name="7e23" id="7e23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So allow me to explain. </p><p name="580b" id="580b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, I hadn’t hit mainstream. Now what the fuck does that mean? Well, put simply, I never really had the opportunity to fully realise how destructive my ego could be, until I’d decided to pursue women.</p><p name="65b7" id="65b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d tried a lot of different things to appease my ego, none of which really gave me that destructive sense of self-worth I was aiming for (though clearly, was completely benign of at the time). I tried doing the YouTube thing and yeah, it worked to an extent, but it was never truly captivating enough for me to delude myself into utter self-harm. My podcast… whatever. </p><p name="910f" id="910f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thinking back, it was like I could never construct a ruse large enough to truly maintain the illusion of my own sense of self-worth. I would either fail, or fail, and come to think of it, I would have failed anyway because of how insecure I was about myself. Pursuing fame was all I knew; or to be more concrete, all I knew at the time was to prop up a damaged, incomplete version of my own personality which I self-identified with, till it all came crashing down. </p><p name="aa7d" id="aa7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, it’s not like mum was giving me hugs and I never really grew up with the confidence or influence to realise it was all bullshit. A loving, hugging environment!? What, with the constant array of failed father figures, alcoholics and suicidal strangers hangin’ round the house, like some kind of collective ploy in Australian communism. Sure, why not. </p><p name="df5b" id="df5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not sure what provoked me, but one day I decided that I really needed to lose my virginity. Nothing else was working and don’t worry, I’m sure it’s some kind of insecure man thing, especially considering the kind of pick up literature I was reading at the time. Basically, I formed the opinion that if you couldn’t get a girl, you couldn’t do shit, and looking back, I really couldn’t do shit at all, though I’m not sure if the two are related. </p><p name="b0c3" id="b0c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Enter Tumblr. I figure, if I can get a Tumblr account, I can use it as a ploy to get women and I was always taught that there were a heap of women on Tumblr. Of course, not just women, but like, really damaged women. Actually, I’m not sure if that was apparent at the time, but to me, it was better than nothing. </p><p name="bfea" id="bfea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I liked the idea of a girl who was mentally ill. I’d always had that indecent fantasy where we would both be lying in a dark, empty room, collectively crying in the corner while we both held each other silently, sobbing. Clearly, sexy.</p><p name="ebd0" id="ebd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I get this Tumblr account and I start talking to girls and it’s a disaster. I more-or-less feel even more cynical and depressed than before and.</p><p name="9697" id="9697" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">use it to get women. The great thing about Tumblr is that there are a heap of women and so </p><p name="404d" id="404d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="1615" id="1615" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="cab4" id="cab4" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="7168" id="7168" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here I am, stuck with this thing. </p><p name="4c7e" id="4c7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a tale of how I built you into a coping mechanism so vast, that it still haunts me till this day. Maybe some context will help. Perhaps in a severe bout of twisted reverse-psychology, I’ll bring up to the two things which trigger me most: My mother and pornography.</p><p name="bc19" id="bc19" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="83ce" id="83ce" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="80de" id="80de" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="d139" id="d139" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
