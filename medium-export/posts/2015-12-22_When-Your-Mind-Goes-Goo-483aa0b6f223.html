Well, I prefer the term contrived.</p><p name="bf20" id="bf20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The level of pain you experience from mental-instability to mental-stability usually comes down to the length of time transpired between the last time you actively practiced some kind of self-awareness and the current moment.</p><p name="6f9d" id="6f9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During those more simpler times, trapped light in the hysteria of thought, it can feel like piecing together an elementary puzzle while feeling slightly intoxicated. I mean, it ain’t so hard because you’ve got all the pieces right there in front of you and the challenge is basic enough that you don’t feel inadvertently intimidated.</p><p name="5fb2" id="5fb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Life is good, because it is easy. You just throw some cheap money at the problem and you continue choking on that fat cigar.</p><p name="14c5" id="14c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet it is in these moments, of course, that we inevitably huff and chuff at the hubris brooding within, completely neglecting at all those taught strings keeping us firm in our uncheckered place.</p><p name="3d56" id="3d56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we’re happy little beings, “fuck you self-awareness”. I have a crusade to mimic.</p><p name="fe06" id="fe06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…and you know what, that’s totally fine. It’s totally fine not to be self-aware in those dazzling moments, because it allows us to focus on the macro of the situation; those big-city goals which common aspirations splutter like bad candy.</p><p name="7df3" id="7df3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then just, oh yes, then just when you’re in the groove of it all, riding the wave of sharp pretension, some toxic asshole prods along and starts smashing up your beautiful mental setup, with a wrench mind you, targeting that delicate seed you planted long ago.</p><p name="58d8" id="58d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is where the mind begins to break down, unable to cope with the sparks of precognition that daddy never taught us about.</p><p name="878a" id="878a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everything goes out the window. You forget everything you once taught yourself about this seed-now-plant; its roots, a fundamental foundation for your mental functioning.</p><p name="c164" id="c164" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You forget the type of plant you were trying to grow, the date at which you planted it. In fact, you completely forget the number of times you must water it to keep the fucking thing alive, along with the location of the fucking plant itself.</p><p name="599e" id="599e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You cannot help but feel like a brave idiot.</p><p name="3c37" id="3c37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The interesting thing is that you still retain some level of self-awareness, yet it doesn’t help to serve you at all. This is because your now wrench-smashed understanding boils down to something so superficial, so benign, that it actually hinders your mental health further.</p><p name="cac2" id="cac2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Like, I get that I shouldn’t take things personally, but what the fuck does that even mean? Where is my fucking clarity? I’m trying to feel grateful you dip shit, but I literally feel nothing but death.”</p><p name="8124" id="8124" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The good news is that with a proper, working understanding of mental illness and self-awareness, this trend does not last long. Usually only days, a week at most in very rare cases.</p><p name="cb0f" id="cb0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you’ve been through the sordid cycle a few dozen times and you have a framework to breathe within, there’s a part of you that knows you’ll be okay, even if you mind feels like the site of a great massacre.</p><p name="b893" id="b893" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe that moment came last night when I was lying in bed after a day of daft feeling. In a moment of calm, it became rather obvious I had been severely affected by my own inability and I guess, for whatever reason, I decided to observe myself.</p><p name="1f1e" id="1f1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Observation is where all self-awareness begins and I guess I realised, in spending an entire day unsuccessfully distracting myself from my thoughts, that something wasn’t right.</p><p name="18c4" id="18c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got out my notepad and within a thirty minutes I knew I would be completely fine the next day.</p><p name="7e3b" id="7e3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No more traumatic assumptions. No more anxiety about who I was; just back on the same ol’ beaten path of survival that we’re all hoping will one day be replaced by a big fat fuckin’ unicorn.</p><p name="316a" id="316a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Inevitably this will happen again.</p><p name="fcd0" id="fcd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will fall down that same sunken road; a road so beautiful yet equally harmed like a child who won’t speak up.</p><p name="304b" id="304b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However I promise there is hope in all the suffering that comes. But be smart. Be real smart about it.</p><p name="5454" id="5454" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Read about therapy. Read every fucking book you can about how others deal with their problems and eventually, you too can be writing a brash post about what recovery means to you.</p></div></div></section>
