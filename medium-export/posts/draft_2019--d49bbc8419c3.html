I mean, it’s not that I even care for social equality, I really just want to be able to separate the shit from the show. </p><p name="d6ad" id="d6ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So is art dead? Well, perhaps not.</p><p name="120d" id="120d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather, it’s contrary that  I now view art, ducks and all things delicious  as a kind of  process, which in a way also removes the magic of bipolar-mania and all things considered. Especially language learning. Talk about a process to end all. </p><p name="f93f" id="f93f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In regards to my life in general, I think it’s safe to say that I feel as if I’m setup for success, and this really does come back to this idea of progression. I feel as if I’m in a great position in my life to continue moving forward, and you don’t  realise how important this feeling is to your overall well-being until you relay with it on a daily basis. Even if it is only the illusory tell-tale of a feeling. </p><p name="ad8f" id="ad8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand,  one thing I haven’t quite understood is that of how to deal with getting older. What I’m noticing is that I’m learning much more about who I do not want to become, rather than who I actually want to be. I suppose through trial and error we discover that we are merely human, and perhaps I feature some kind of sunken flaw that character itself cannot reveal. </p><p name="0af9" id="0af9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, here is my list a la carte:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5478" id="5478" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">I bought a house.</strong> It’s a really nice house and now that it’s been moved-in (it’s literally only been like, a week) it’s something which I’m  incredibly excited about. I’ve been to Bunnings more times than you can imagine, but now that I have a garage full of tools I feel like I have everything  necessary in order to start improving the place. Hell, I’ve even planted a bloody avocado tree in the back, so it’s gonna be epic. Of course, buying a house has also been an incredibly stressful experience that I would literally equate to dating. If you hated dating, especially the uncertainty of it all, you’ll also hate buying a house. Every. Single. Minute. Of. It. </li><li name="9312" id="9312" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">I tried my hand at a lifestyle business.</strong> Although it gained a lot of traction, it was not monetarily successful (it could have been if I kept at it) but ultimately what I realised is that it simply wasn’t for me. I liked building a following, as well as being recognised as an expert by others, however my main issue was that it was EXTREMELY time consuming — which in particular was affecting my work and relationship. Perhaps I would have continued if I were single. Regardless, I learnt a lot about business and it was a fantastic experience. </li><li name="138d" id="138d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">I reconnected with my mother, then I ditched her again.</strong> I think sometime around 2016 I’d decided that I had enough with her. Anyway, I was completely content with the whole situation and then she got back in touch and I thought, yeah sure, why not. Anyway, after a year I’d decided that I couldn’t deal with her again and so I said bye-bye. I think what I realised is that there was nothing there. She’s just a mother-by-name, but there was absolutely no feeling there at all. Meeting her simply felt like an obligation, just as it did the previous 24 years of my life. You can’t flog a dead horse, especially if you’re not filming it with the intention of  putting it on the internet. Do I feel guilt? Sure. Should I? No one EVER should. </li><li name="f4d1" id="f4d1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">I overcame porn addiction.</strong> It seems so surreal and distant, but I actually did it. It’s weird because I don’t remember being an addict at all, given it’s been so long since I last partook, but I know in retrospect it’s probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my entire life. Put it this way, I started when I was 10, so imagine trying to overcome that habit at 26. In general, 2019 has been fantastic for my mental health. I mean, it wasn’t perfect for 100% of 2019, far from it, however  overall I felt largely in-control of myself and that’s been awesome. Meditation is a must. It will save your soul.</li><li name="3df0" id="3df0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">I landed my first large corporate gig.</strong> For the past few years I’d been confined to working at agencies and start ups, where the dread hovel and the gnarks come out at night. I’d never wanted to work in those institutions, but as most careers go,  you’re limited by your level of experience i.e. the lowest bidder, who also happens to be a complete jerk. Well, finally I got into a really amazing company and it’s been a really positive experience overall. Ya see, this is progression, baby. </li><li name="2cf9" id="2cf9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">I caught swine flu.</strong> Talk about a real mother-fucker. It was easily the worst two weeks of my entire life. Imagine being completely covered in sweat to a point of being drenched, as you attempt to sleep in a swimming-pool of your own filth. Vomiting constantly. Overheating to a point of literally collapsing on the floor. I’d never quite understood it, but it genuinely feels as if it’s trying to kill you.</li><li name="a759" id="a759" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">I decided to learn Japanese, again. </strong>Prior to starting my lifestyle business I was learning Japanese. Then obviously priorities changed, think I’d be able to learn Japanese infinitely once I’d become an internet millionaire. Of course, that didn’t happen, so I eventually returned back to learning Japanese. While I’ve stopped learning it since I’ve been so busy working on the new house, I think maybe I’ll return to it again soon. I think I’ve managed to </li></ul><p name="7f5f" id="7f5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Obviously, this is only a brief summary of the events that took place. An entire year of just …living. </p><p name="109b" id="109b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think as a person I’ve become a lot more casual about life. In the first half the year I sort of went a bit manic and “go-go-go” in regards to building my business, but I consciously decided to let go of that. Am I better off for it? I don’t know, but mentally I think I’m doing the right thing. </p><p name="525f" id="525f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose one thing I’m in desperate need of is inspiration. I suppose moving into the new place has provided some level of inspiration, but it’s not quite as good as a form of inspiration, than say, travel is. Which obviously due to buying a house has not been on the cards for a while. </p><p name="cbc4" id="cbc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless, I can say that I’m excited for 2020. Like I say, I feel setup for success and that really cannot be understated. I’ve really taken to gardening and home-improvement. I might take up reading. I might start getting back into drawing, now that I have a proper study setup (I was living in an apartment previously, and there was like, literally no room to do anything).</p><p name="b68c" id="b68c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
