I was thinking about it on the plane ride back and it’s something which is simple to understand, yet difficult to truly appreciate. </p><p name="c2f7" id="c2f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So basically, we have these stories which we tell ourselves. You know, this person makes me really angry because he’s a prick, or I feel really guilty because I ruined this person’s life. These stories make us sad, because we feel the emotion contained within these stories, as a way perhaps to hold us responsible to our actions.</p><p name="5787" id="5787" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, these stories are not real. They are just fabrications we hold in our head. What gives them power is the faith and attention we place on them, which make them feel real. Our emotions confirm that they are real, even though they could not possibly be real. Think about it, we are just existing right here, without any kind of premonition of the world. Yet somewhere in our head, is a story, or a lie, or some kind of notion that we are worthless or that we are in danger.</p><p name="d8c7" id="d8c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the risk and danger of truama. It is an unexpected, often sinsidious aspect of our personality, which ravishes as much as it torments. Trauma makes the potential for these negative emotions strong. It changes the way you think and feel about life. </p><p name="04da" id="04da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, there are several ways we can go about these stories. We can create counter-stories which change the way we feel, which is counter-intuitive, because it relies on using further lies to trick us into believing. Furthermore, at some point, those bad stories are going to eventually return and destroy us, through our ignorance or often accident. We leave our mental health to chance, and emotional reaction. </p><p name="ff3a" id="ff3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Preferably, what we want to do is dissolve and expose these stories for what they are: lies. This means living without story to guide us throughout the world, which is daunting and seemingly impossible at first. </p><p name="5c8f" id="5c8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the issue is that these stories somewhat amplify reality. Like when you watch a movie, it really evokes a certain emotion and way of feeling. Without story however, we instead have to create our own emotions internally, which is a completely foreign and new concept to people. It also becomes incredibly difficult when you realise that stories are very easy to create. In fact, the way we communicate with others is through story and it is something we are quite conscious of. Often we want to evoke a big reaction, which is why we exaggerate details to try and make them feel a certain way. </p><p name="3941" id="3941" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other side to this equation is that we also tend to take these stories very personally. We really get ourselves emotionally involved within these stories (by definition) and it captures us. Thus it is important that we:</p><p name="7454" id="7454" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do not take these stories personally, as well as to not make assumptions about these stories. </p><p name="ea67" id="ea67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A large part of it comes down to habit, and to dissolve these stories is an attempt to try and reverse an entire lifetime of thinking patterns. Living without story is difficult. It’s difficult because everything in our past no longer makes sense without story, since we’ve been living our entire life with story. In fact, part of the reason for our breakdown, is that we had so many different conflicting, confusing and impossible-to-verify stories that our mind simply combusted into a non-workable state. </p><p name="1662" id="1662" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The alternative is to focus on the present moment, so that our mind does not wander to what it cannot understand. This is difficult within itself because our curiosity often takes us to the past, where our pain once resided. This is especially true when we live without pain for a while, and our past becomes this kind of important relic of truth. So it’s like an unnecessary cycle, which continually destroys us. </p><p name="f6aa" id="f6aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main question I am asking, is how we can possibly interpret the past without the use of story, considering that is all we have? One approach is to look at these past events for what they are. “I broke up with this girl because it wasn’t working out”. At the same time, we risk over simplifying what happened, particularly when it comes to trying to explain who we are.</p><p name="5789" id="5789" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that’s why we return back to the past. At some point in our lives, we lose sense of who we are. We want answers. We want to be able to answer our apparent suffering or inability to do whatever, and we .</p><p name="c6c3" id="c6c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe that’s why it makes sense to just let go of the past entirely. Of course, that’s impossible. Actually, maybe that’s not true. Anything is possible, it just requires some initiative. Some. Initiative. Possibly. Yeah baby. Dooooo it. </p><p name="d13b" id="d13b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How does one interpret what they cannot understand without making assumptions and without simplifying what happened?</p><p name="2b68" id="2b68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Perhaps that is the problem, in trying to understand what cannot be understood. PErhaps that is the very definition of desperation. Certainly, it must be. </p></div></div></section>
