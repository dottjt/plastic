Though perhaps amazing isn’t a particularly appropriate word, considering that it implies out of the ordinary. I would not like to hope that today is out of the ordinary, otherwise that would imply somewhat limited and rare.</p><p name="51cf" id="51cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today has been a demonstration of what everyday should be like. Simply, functioning and happy. Those are the two qualities of today which I would like to carry with me into the future. I managed to achieve what I wanted and I would like to think that with enough practice, I can become amazing and full of hope, almost all the time.</p><p name="0b5c" id="0b5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though I wonder…. I am not infallible and it is important that I maintain some semblance of self-awareness and meditation, rather than allow myself to be so… I’m not sure, however I think there’s a level of thoughtlessness to my actions. Is that even true though? Perhaps this is what peace and normality is about? Being free of bad thoughts and living without trauma?</p><p name="9649" id="9649" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, it’s a balance. I need to keep myself away from the people who cause issue in my life, as well as maintain my ability to be calm and knowledgable. </p><p name="3a7d" id="3a7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I really would like to express my blessing towards my own life. I feel blessed to have all the amazing things that I do have in my life. I feel blessed to have a full-time job. I feel blessed to have an amazing partner who loves me and cares about me. I feel as if I have accepted a lot of things in my life, about who I am and who I can be. </p><p name="b759" id="b759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately however, it is not until you are at your most vulnerable, at your weakest point, that your own life and struggle becomes relevant to you in that moment. It is at those points where you really display your true character of who you are. </p><p name="072d" id="072d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel a little sad thinking about all the people of my past. In a sense, it was just who I was. However, I’m glad that I’m away from it all, that I’m away from all the harm and all the horrible things that I’ve done. Of course, they’re just stories. Stories which are no longer relevant to my life. Stories which have no place in the love that I exhibit everyday, to the people in my life who need me most. </p><p name="953d" id="953d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I have my own life now. I have my own hobbies, my own talents, my own ambitions and goals to truly embrace and give it my all. Life is not always the easy, cheerful, amazing experience that people make it out to be, however I’m doing a lot of things right and I’m so bloody glad, that I have the opportunity and experience to make it my own. </p></div></div></section>
