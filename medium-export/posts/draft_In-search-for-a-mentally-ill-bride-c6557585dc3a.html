They are still stuck and riddled within their own mind games, as if time has stopped and placed an eventually timer on their soul.</p><p name="7bc4" id="7bc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve always been a particularly morbid and curious individual, with a slight fascination with the mentally ill. All my friends were severely mentally ill to some extent; either avid drug addicts engulfed in the depression or those so obsessed with body image that they were willing to get plastic surgery (and mind you, this person was a guy, contrary to common stereotype).</p><p name="f206" id="f206" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Naturally, I was somewhere in-between. An addicted, paranoid, hopeless zombie with an exude for human depravity. I was a true born cynic and I very rarely got along with anyone. Part of me did not want to. I wanted all the hatred for myself.</p><p name="c4a0" id="c4a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was sold on this idea that I needed a mentally ill girlfriend.</p><p name="f978" id="f978" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I thought that by finding someone like me, I would have a better chance of connecting.</p><p name="b796" id="b796" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the end, it turned out to be one of the best (and worst) decisions of my entire life. </p><p name="be46" id="be46" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="9376" id="9376" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the thing about mental illness that you don’t realise until after you learn to control it: Everyone is mentally ill.</p><p name="364a" id="364a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not until you become self-aware of your own destructive habits, do you also become aware of all the destructive habits of others. </p><p name="ceb4" id="ceb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, it is not that I am not without flaw. I still have a difficult time empathising, however I have also learnt that it is something we learn from life. We are all ignorant souls at our core. </p><p name="aef9" id="aef9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The true beauty of mental illness in an intimate situation, however, is that there is a level of humility to it. There’s a level of awareness that something is not right, which is an important first step for change. </p><p name="a6ec" id="a6ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back then, there was just something dull, something unwarranted and predictable of those who I considered normal.</p><p name="0c65" id="0c65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My main reason is that we’re all mentally ill to some respect.</p><p name="c334" id="c334" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">At least by finding someone who was mentally ill,</p></div></div></section>
