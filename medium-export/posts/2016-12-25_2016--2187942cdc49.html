So much happened. Parts of me got wet. A few ethnic minorities probably suffered due to my penny-ante reliance on palm oil.</p><p name="880f" id="880f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly if you must know, I’m currently dry-humping a casket of red for a new video I’m shooting, and yet nothing feels particularly different. I think this signifies the importance of consistently taking action towards change, rather than hoping to be uplifted by some grand feeling of progression and euphoria.</p><p name="eb0f" id="eb0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because it just doesn’t exist. The reality is that positive change is a lot of hard work, with very little tactical reward. So suck it up fatty. The crust is on me.</p><p name="2bbf" id="2bbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless, I think 2016 has been an amazing year and I feel like I’ve grown so much as an individual, achieving a lot of what I set out to do.</p><h3 name="b473" id="b473" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I became a truly self-sufficient adult.</h3><p name="2fc4" id="2fc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In 2016 I did something that was truly remarkable.</p><p name="d333" id="d333" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I disowned my mother and told her to fuck off, and I cannot even tell you how much my mental health has improved since then. One of the hardest things I’ve to deal with in my mind is resist this idea that my so-called “family” and the relationship I had with my mother was somehow normal.</p><p name="c24d" id="c24d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because it was nothing short of abusive.</p><p name="4e0e" id="4e0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Living out of home has been an incredibly enlightening experience and if you’re a young millennial, it’s something I whole-heartedly recommend. Understandably it will chew through your savings, however it’s a side-effect that will drive and motivate you to try harder and become better at this whole “capitalism” thing.</p><p name="7549" id="7549" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which trust me, will serve you much better in the long-run than saving a few grand leeching off the parents.</p><p name="143e" id="143e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It has taught me the importance of time-management, planning ahead for the future, as well as placing a true monetary value on the hard money I earn each week. Not to mention, better manage my emotions, negotiate and tolerate others for who they are, in light of my housemate who is more-or-less the complete opposite to me in nearly every single way.</p><p name="cbc0" id="cbc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fuck you, loveable asshole.</p><p name="0c4f" id="0c4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, living out of home has set my priorities straight in life and it’s something I’m incredibly grateful for.</p><h3 name="5348" id="5348" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I became a programmer.</h3><p name="667f" id="667f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Something else remarkable also happened for me in 2016.</p><p name="436d" id="436d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was the year I finally felt comfortable working with code. You know, computer code.</p><p name="538f" id="538f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can now write code in most programming languages, and not feel as if I’m not in-control or that I don’t understand what’s happening conceptually on a higher or lower level on the machine. It’s like, I understand the 1’s and 0’s and I can debug an application without breaking down into a pile of jelly.</p><p name="b692" id="b692" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, I think the defining moment for any beginning programmer is when you can rely on the official documentation of the api you’re using, rather than on the safety of user tutorials which explain everything step-by-step. I think the next step will be when I can read and understand the actual source code of the libraries and frameworks I use, although the idea of that terrifies me.</p><p name="0e41" id="0e41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There have been two main reasons for my success.</p><p name="2bf7" id="2bf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, I spend approximately five hours reading, writing and learning the stuff each day, so I’ve gotten pretty good at it. Secondly, I’ve covered just about every aspect of computer science in my study. In 2016 I learnt C, C++, C#, React/Redux, Express, Functional JavaScript, Clojure, Vue, Databases, FeathersJS, Koa, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Assembly Language, Static Site Generators, and blah, blah, baaaah.</p><p name="9fb4" id="9fb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I even spent a few months learning physics and mathematics, which helped me better understand the intricacies of logic. As part of my three-week learning cycles (as I like to call them) I’m currently learning about web security and UI/UX design, and I find it exhilarating.</p><p name="7a15" id="7a15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I eventually want to become a dedicated developer at some point, I’m lucky enough to be able to work with code in my current job, so there’s no rush for me. Particularly as I really like the company I’m currently with, so I want to ride that wave for a while.</p><h3 name="bfcd" id="bfcd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I paid off my debts and sorted out my finances.</h3><p name="fb49" id="fb49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Believe it or not, I actually managed to pay off all my student debt this year.</p><p name="de84" id="de84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All twenty something thousand of it.</p><p name="ae32" id="ae32" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a result I’ve been consistently poor, and the worst thing is that I’ll forget why I’m poor, however this is my current reminder: It’s because I have no debt. Not to mention, an entire house full of furniture, tools and utensils, which more-or-less will cover everything myself and my partner will need into the future, so we can start saving our money for larger purchases.</p><p name="23f6" id="23f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not entirely sure if I regret paying off my university debt, since it’s low-cost debt, however I knew it was something I had to do for myself. My girlfriend also paid off all her debt and we’re now in the process of saving up for a deposit on a house! We also started using budgeting software for the first time and it’s been absolutely wonderful for our finances. We hope to start investing at some point, but it’s something we’re still trying to figure things out.</p><h3 name="10b4" id="10b4" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I got super fit.</h3><p name="6b25" id="6b25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I bought a weight set for $220 over gumtree, and I’ve gotten incredibly fit as a result of my physical activities. I work out three times a week and I’ve made incredible progress. Here is how I’ve improved over the past six months:</p><p name="0f14" id="0f14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Deadlift from 70LB to 208LB.</p><p name="c0af" id="c0af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Squat from 65LB to 178LB.</p><p name="fdfe" id="fdfe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bench Press from 45kg to 62.5kg.</p><p name="8843" id="8843" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, most days I’ll sprint to the bus-stop on the way to work, and if I’m feeling adventurous I’ll then do four sprints at the bus stop, and I’ll sprint 3–4 times on the last stretch from the train station to work.</p><p name="e64d" id="e64d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s quite addictive, I’ll say.</p><h3 name="c89c" id="c89c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I changed jobs and figured out my career path.</h3><p name="047c" id="047c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Half-way through this year I decided to take a massive gamble.</p><p name="6717" id="6717" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I decided to leave my incredibly stable PR &amp; Communications position, in pursuit for something else. Because the fact was, I absolutely hated my job and it was destroying me on so many levels.</p><p name="aba1" id="aba1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason it was a gamble was because a) I was leaving after 10 months and so it looked like I’d been fired b) Whilst I didn’t want to work in Communications, it is more-or-less the only thing I was “qualified” for on paper c) Communications positions were almost non-existent and d) I was nowhere near good enough to become a coder, yet it was all I wanted to do.</p><p name="e9fc" id="e9fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I was basically fucked.</p><p name="e1e0" id="e1e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And let me tell you, it was incredibly difficult.</p><p name="edae" id="edae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I attended god-knows how many interviews and admittedly, I did turn down a few job offers that weren’t to my liking, however I learnt so much about the job seeking process and learnt so much about myself, that it was totally worth it. It’s not until you’re truly under the pump, with rent and bills to pay in a somewhat shit situation, that you learn to rise up and shine.</p><p name="816b" id="816b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Following a gruelling two+ month process, I finally landed the perfect job, and it made me realise something very important in life. Precisely, that it’s vitally important that you always stay true to yourself. If it weren’t for all those silly side-projects I’d loved doing, in addition to all that time spent coding, I simply wouldn’t be where I am today.</p><p name="2f0f" id="2f0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because remember: The right opportunities find you in the end. You just have to persevere and remember than every single rejection you receive is a reflection of the opportunity before you, not a reflection of your own talents or self-worth.</p><p name="a49f" id="a49f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, a lot easier said in reflection. Chances are, you will crumble, as I certainly did to a large degree.</p><h3 name="220e" id="220e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I sorted out a lot of my mental health issues.</h3><p name="d22d" id="d22d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m still not perfect, but I’ve gotten a lot better.</p><p name="8449" id="8449" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I dunno, it’s sort of like this intricate puzzle I have to figure out, and while I have some pieces sorted and in place, there are still aspects of my life that continue to confuse me.</p><p name="89ef" id="89ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I largely understand the routine I need to stick to in order to stay trouble-free, but it’s the outlier events that end up destroying me.</p><p name="a3e4" id="a3e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My two primary weaknesses are when I don’t get enough sleep, or when I fall sick. Thankfully I don’t fall sick often, but when I’m tired, either because I’ve been fighting with my girlfriend late into the night or because I’ve been unable to sleep, I’ll usually relapse into a puddle of filth that enables all the bad qualities I’d traditionally been able to filter and control. This usually happens once every 2 to 4 weeks.</p><p name="e9cc" id="e9cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other than that, I’m like a machine.</p><p name="591b" id="591b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, I’m not entirely sure what to improve. I think one thing I need to do for myself is read back through my old blog post and get comfortable with my younger self. Because I think part of the issue is that I still feel a lot of guilt about who I was with my depression and general horribleness, so I think if I can no longer feel weird about that, it will allow me to stop feeling bad about myself and realise that… well, I’m not quite sure yet. Maybe it’s something 2017 me can answer.</p><h3 name="de43" id="de43" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I created a few things.</h3><p name="bb25" id="bb25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m quite happy with what I managed to create this year.</p><p name="b68c" id="b68c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I briefly went back to making YouTube videos, which was kind of cool. I also started drawing for the first time! I think I enjoyed it, but it’s just not a priority in my life right now. I mean, I’d love to spend more time learning French, but code, code, code.</p><p name="38e7" id="38e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In particular, I was really happy with my writing this year, especially here on Medium. I absolutely love writing, especially in that kind of broken, dainty style of nonsensical cherish, and it’s something I hope to explore further into 2017.</p><p name="d15d" id="d15d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My writing is constantly improving and I’ve written some of my favourite things ever over the past six months, and I’m also really happy with my main website <a href="https://www.juliusreade.com/" data-href="https://www.juliusreade.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.juliusreade.com/</a></p><p name="df2e" id="df2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like the feeling and intention it’s trying to convey, and I like the pacing of the content. Regardless, it’s something that I enjoy doing with my spare time.</p><h3 name="1fb8" id="1fb8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I have a lovely and supportive partner.</h3><p name="4aad" id="4aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I really want to mention my girlfriend, because I really wouldn’t be where I am today without her. She’s such an amazing human being and it’s been a big year for us. We’ve both grown together in such amazing ways and it’s been a beautiful thing to be a part of.</p><p name="c362" id="c362" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, I very rarely have much to say about her, but I think that’s because we’re incredibly comfortable together. Maybe that’s just what long-term relationships are like; a condition where love needs no words.</p><h3 name="8176" id="8176" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">I’m incredibly excited for 2017.</h3><p name="0354" id="0354" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There’s so much to look forward to in 2017.</p><p name="4044" id="4044" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have absolutely everything I need for my success in life and it’s incredibly empowering to be in this kind of position. While it’s been a lot of hard work, I know it will be worth it in the end.</p><p name="2e97" id="2e97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, part of me is also scared. The stock market is due to end its natural seven year cycle, including as part of a massive grand cycle, which means it’s going to be some tough times ahead. If you believe in the fourth turning theory of history, this will also mean war and with Trump elected — it’s basically going to be a shit-storm.</p><p name="e476" id="e476" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless, life goes on.</p><p name="44e9" id="44e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not going to stop me from pursuing my dreams. It just signifies the importance of being prepared. Now’s the time to start building marketable skills and save money. Hell, even if I have to put on a uniform with a gun, I’ll still be fitter than most people to deal with the extremities of war.</p><p name="28c9" id="28c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Oh, and my startup. Let’s see how that pans out. Honestly, zero expectations. I just want to be able to build an online SaaS application to learn from, and contribute towards my coding resume.</p></div></div></section>
