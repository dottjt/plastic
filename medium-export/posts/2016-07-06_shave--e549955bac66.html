It looks very 1920&#39;s Paris: a cheap reminder that nostalgia works as an effective marketing strategy for those not yet even born.</p><p name="9178" id="9178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His white barber’s outfit drapes his stomach in collaboration with a decade’s worth of loose hair and self-confidence. The black lace trimming, well, secretly suggests he’s an out-of-work chef. Did I mention that he was Italian? The kind of Italian that enjoys a nice bottle of red with an appropriate serving of light pasta, if only to fill the air with an aromatic bliss. Florence is at peace.</p><p name="9570" id="9570" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though come to think of it, he could have been French, Brazilian, maybe even Moroccan, and yet here I am, comparing him to an open-casket Mussolini. It’s clear I’m just a racist.</p><p name="dbcf" id="dbcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Getting a haircut is a lot like going a date without the assumed romance; an uneven silence in the harrowing of our self-interest, blooming without the foundations which love has self-professed for thousands of years. Hopelessly quiet, we felt like an old couple at a nursing home, fading in and out of a deep sleep, continually waking up to a loved one in an unconscious daze of holy matrimony.</p><p name="597c" id="597c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neither of us talked.</p><p name="d251" id="d251" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, we were comfortable with each other and besides, I wouldn’t have known what to say. Maybe that’s what paid sex is like: you both just fuck each other until someone gets fed up, or worse, dies. Terrifying.</p><p name="ca5c" id="ca5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, it’s usually just best to stare into the mirror and watch your complexion diminish into an ever-more defined roundness, preoccupying the unforgiving expansion of your baby-like face. Maybe it’s all that coke I’ve been snorting lately? Oh, don’t be silly. We were both keenly aware I lacked any such sufficient funds to indulge in such mindless occurrences.</p><p name="e7ef" id="e7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One could say he was effortlessly, and I think he knew it too. Decise and docile, he left not a single decision to thought. The snipping came naturally, almost too naturally, like a goat grazing in a field of snail pellets amongst a few patches of dead grass. Uninteresting, I assure you.</p><p name="37f6" id="37f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hard to describe something so intimate, something so intricately special as getting a haircut from an authentic Italian and/or French and/or Brazilian and/or Moroccan. It almost felt a bit like having dinner with your childhood idol, like a prophetic disease which clamours onto your soul and bleeds into a tin can for public reuse.</p><p name="851f" id="851f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe it was an enamoured rock star you once cherished, felt eyeliner dripping from the skull, or an author with a knack for delivering gruesome hysteria in the form of chad cluttney. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter because it’s dinner and you’re probably not paying, except are you are paying in this case, for which you should feel ashamed. I suppose in MY eyes it truly felt as if you were gaining something more than just a haircut, but rather, something tangible to take home with you and share with the world.</p><p name="ff9e" id="ff9e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As somewhat of a haircut connoisseur (despite the fact that I was pressured into getting the haircut, making me a rampant liar) I like to close my eyes and just listen to the hair disappear around me. It’s a bit like those movie scenes where the character is unconscious and you can’t quite tell what’s going on, only with the added benefit of knowing that you’re probably going to look a bit better once you do choose to open your eyes.</p><p name="48e3" id="48e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unless of course, your movie partner is Brad Pitt. Everything looks better when your movie partner is Brad Pitt.</p><p name="199a" id="199a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Getting up from my chair, I proceeded to put my suit jacket on and walk towards the pseudo-podium where I would be thrown a non-negotiable figure. I then responded appropriately by diving into the corner, pulling my gun out to shoot him in the head.</p><p name="41ca" id="41ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At least that’s what would have been cool and daring, as I slowly handed him a $20 note from my pocket. You know, I really should have been annoyed at the fact that the billboard outside claimed a $15 price for men’s haircuts, however I lacked the energy or courage.</p><p name="b1a2" id="b1a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I was too happy to care.</p></div></div></section>
