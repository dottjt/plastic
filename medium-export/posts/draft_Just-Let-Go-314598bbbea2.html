I suppose to the sentimental being, everything is as precious as the day it was first borne and this really captures the essence of why my mind isn’t working as smoothly, nor as beautifully as it should. </p><p name="d752" id="d752" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This fundamental idea of ‘letting go’ feels quaint like an insatiable burden; one which cannot be weighed, yet tires endless on the back of my shoulders, digging in deeper than I hoped it would allow. </p><p name="9b2c" id="9b2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Memories to the sentimental person, no matter how ugly, are beautiful, and even when they stop you in your tracks and hurt you. Undeniably it is a pain I have tolerated my entire life and is something I am beginning to change, despite my unordeal attachment to the lesser qualities of my brain.</p><p name="b2ee" id="b2ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bad thoughts and prior trauma. Bad dates don’t deserve a second chance, however neither should sickness. So please, I beg you to stop stowing away the sadness that gathers like dust in the back of your mind; as if sickness were some kind of utilitarian cure to the depravation brewing ill in this dim mind of mind, begging for something a little brighter.</p><p name="2684" id="2684" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I keep onto my bad thoughts and memories because I believe they must be reasoned with. Argued with. Contemplated for the sake of obsession. Agonised in a brutal rumination that consumes and fights over my thoughts, taunting with no reason or shame.</p><p name="4ec8" id="4ec8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe not today. Maybe not in 10 years, however at some point, poked and prodded, my bad decisions and regretful past aims to one day enlighten me with a vital, almost improved understanding of who I am as a human being. </p><p name="e5a8" id="e5a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At least that’s how the story goes in my mind, idiotic creature. Of course I know it’s all bullshit. I’m just a shit creature, destined to cry out in feigned misery as a way to cope at the fact that I’m clearly not coping. </p><p name="1877" id="1877" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though knowing is a lot different to believing and I’m certainly not committed to the idea letting go. Deep down inside however, I know that all my fears are a big lie and it’s a realisation I work towards crucify everyday. </p><p name="6d5e" id="6d5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These lies, you know, they’re terrifying.  They exist as dreams and images in the mind; in a world where the stories of the past cannot tell the difference between fiction and stardust. Yet when  you become so attached to these dreams and images, they eat away at you in verifiable fashion and truly form a vicious life of their own. </p><p name="e362" id="e362" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, I decided to block my ex from Facebook.</p><p name="bb0a" id="bb0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While it doesn’t sound like much, it’s a huge step for people like me who find themselves in the position of victim. It’s a position of fear, a position of haste, where the idea of letting go as hideous as it is gargantuan.</p><p name="a2c5" id="a2c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I held onto the idea that we could one day be friends again. It’s hard to say if it’s something I truly believed, however it was what my mind has always told me. Don’t let go. Maybe she’s a good thing in your life. You know, like believing in god, just in case the whole thing turns out to be real. </p><p name="20ad" id="20ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I just wanted to her to confirm my worst fears about our relationship; the truth behind what had actually taken place. Which lets be honest, I have no clue about. It’s something that eats away at me. </p><p name="30f3" id="30f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew I was ruminating again. Hopefully I’ll stop. </p><p name="cf54" id="cf54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Never mind the fact that we hate each other. We have a kind of massive chasm of misunderstanding that stands between us. I know my mind plays tricks on itself, skewing my focus towards things that aren’t quite there. That clear moment you first got together, that cheerful gleam in her eyes. Oh fine, that was years ago, but can’t a man dream?</p><p name="1ed6" id="1ed6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember convincing myself that she was the one. It was a message I would tell myself each and every day. It was a message that beat like a worldly drum into my mind and I would drum it to the point that my neural networks were bleeding from the overload, tantilising my mind into fucking misery: I knew she was perfect in every single way.</p><p name="911f" id="911f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, she wasn’t perfect. </p><p name="b889" id="b889" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, she was so imperfect that it was like I had to continually remind myself that she was a goddess, and that with enough patience, it would all work out. Never mind the fact that she cheated on me. My, my, doesn’t that band-aid look all nice on your forehead? It won’t stop the bleeding but at least I won’t feel like shit the next time you fall over and break something. </p><p name="7d53" id="7d53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the very least it begs to mention that she had terrible mental issues. All my partners did, but in a haze of young love, just hand over the gasoline and let this baby burn. The issue is that I found the dysfunction romantic. I was a fiend for young regret and it’s something my mind still hopes to taste. </p><p name="beee" id="beee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yep. I’m one of those fools who romanticises mental illness and it’s totally not right. Expect for the fact that I’m also mentally ill and can barely hold my head up straight when there’s a fucking wind blowing around.</p><p name="a2e3" id="a2e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not that there’s anything  fun or sexy about being mentally ill, you see. It’s just how my mind works. Call it an exposé, you delicious tard.</p><p name="7f48" id="7f48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Images feel real, even if they’re not. My mind creates vivid images of a multitude of things and it makes them so convincing to a point that I believe I’m truly insane. I suppose a large part of my recovery from being a sentimental wanker, is to try and live life without image. </p><p name="b7f8" id="b7f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s just so difficult when it’s so easy to convey your emotions with a violent outburst of hacking or cowering, compared to the kind of patience that is required to come to your own senses. </p><p name="1987" id="1987" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These people and memories in my mind, I have come to realise, are just symbols. They’re  not real. </p><p name="adb6" id="adb6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe  attachment is a bad thing. I always wonder whether fear and passion are the same thing and in a lot of ways, passion merely feels like fear that you are unconscious of. Fear that makes itself subtle, gently reminding you, yet not terrifying you with guilt and insolence. </p><p name="d5dc" id="d5dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose that’s what makes me feel most guilty about my first break up: this idea that I didn’t sacrifice enough for her, that I didn’t go all the way to be the best version of myself and make it right. Are you catching onto this at all? Yep, it’s all probably bullshit. I’m just yet to believe it myself. </p><p name="29ed" id="29ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I was scared. Ruminate. Maybe I was acting rationally. Ruminate. Part of me felt as if love was something you sacrificed to the very end. Ruminate. Until literally had no more to give and you were begging for her back. Runimate. It’s a very tragic way of looking at love and arguably, some bullshit I had conjured from a television show. Oh, yes. Ruminate with me baby.</p><p name="eb92" id="eb92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I got rid of her. You know, to stop the rumination. I got rid of her, but more importantly, part of me maybe realises that I never had her to begin with. </p><p name="0b4f" id="0b4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And what does it even mean to have someone? And what is so special about her? Of course, now this is just turning into rumination and bleh, bleh, blah. </p><p name="306a" id="306a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who really knows what’s truly going on inside my mind. Most importantly, gratitude excercises… well, they sort of help.</p><p name="573d" id="573d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
