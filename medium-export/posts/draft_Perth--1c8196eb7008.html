My mind refuses to breathe, but I’m sure that’s just one of the many pretty side-effects of my pain. In fact, my mind has most likely died at this point, reconfirming my worst fears that this is actually a manuscript from the future, as if human progress ever deserved such things.</p><p name="96ae" id="96ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would make a lot more sense if I were a burrito. You could fill me with rice and when you are done with me, leave me on the plate to be churned into someone else’s dinner. At least that’s how they do it here at Taco Bill: a tactically resourceful chain of ill-forgotten events. I’m not making much sense now, but the writing is enjoyable. </p><p name="10d8" id="10d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lovely like a pillow. Swift like a bird. I want to run my hand along a piece of metal and extract the essence of what madman designed this structure. Of course, the structure isn’t real. It’s all in my head and it’s a playground filled with danger and excitement. </p><p name="2882" id="2882" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The plane ride was ugly. Though let’s not talk about the journey and instead gaze our eyes on the achievement of the hour, for I have achieved plenty today. Aside from my recent addiction to Fallout Shelter, I managed to spend a lot of time learning about algorithms and data structures, which means I effectively got paid to learn. Lucky me. </p><p name="7299" id="7299" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I cannot say I’m the biggest fan of these travels. In fact, it has gotten to the point that travelling no longer feels so much like a holiday, as it does routine. I like the luxury, however it’s not luxury I’m looking for in my life. It’s consistency in my goals and ability to exceed, which is something which this lifestyle doesn’t lend towards. Oh, who am I kidding. I clearly overwork myself and am making good use of my mind. </p><p name="33b7" id="33b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s interesting to observe the mind as you learn. It’s like, the more you learn, the less your brain is able to compose itself together and eventually you learn so much, that you mind becomes an incomprehensible mush. It’s like you build up an incredible tension in your mind, which it cannot choose whether it wants to relax or simply combust. </p><p name="9f31" id="9f31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For dinner I decided to buy a few items to sustain me over the coming days. As per usual, I ended up buying a tad bit too much, however thankfully it is food I can bring back to Melbourne. </p><ul class="postList"><li name="4fea" id="4fea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Olive Oil (regret purchase, as it is not needed)</li><li name="7c5a" id="7c5a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Cheese (semi-regret purchase, as it will probably not be all eaten)</li><li name="bb70" id="bb70" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Roasted Chicken (best purchase ever)</li><li name="5b05" id="5b05" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Butter (obligatory)</li><li name="88c1" id="88c1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Two tomatoes</li><li name="c7d6" id="c7d6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">CHUNKY TOMATO SAUCE</li><li name="4127" id="4127" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A reduced coleslaw mix</li></ul><p name="60ec" id="60ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">As well as the rice, pepper and salt I usually bring with me. </p><p name="a18c" id="a18c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
