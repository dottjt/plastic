I don’t mean this as a pessimist, but rather, as someone who has observed and witnessed the complete obliteration of Europe’s economies over the past five years. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal aaaaand just about everyone except Germany, stand as a steed for the helpless and incapable, sucking down communal indignity with an ever-so artificial grime.</p><p name="768b" id="768b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s long been known that you can only thump a dead squirrel alive so long, until your arm becomes sore and the incessant cries of failure and restitution beat morale down to an empty pulp. Maybe we could learn a thing or two from Medieval torture as a viable option for those who cannot afford private healthcare.</p><p name="2010" id="2010" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless, this is not the real reason why I am pro-Brexit. In fact, if you must know, I hardly care about Brexit which is what makes it all-the-more intriguing.</p><p name="1668" id="1668" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real reason I am pro-Brexit is because I hold a strong belief that history is deterministic. This is to say, cyclical. There’s a very good reason why the average lifespan of an empire is 250 years, as well as why we typically suffer some great crisis every 70, placing a new twist on the old we once fancied.</p><p name="12bf" id="12bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From freedom comes tyranny and from tyranny breeds the soul of another human being, shouting from their lungs at the destruction of their beloved government some few generations later. Brexit is nothing unique. Just as humans have fought before, humans will continue to disintegrate and form alliances in the most irrational of ways.</p><p name="a5c6" id="a5c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most counter-intuitive thing a person can do is live in fear at these decisions; decisions neither you nor I have any choice over. To be against the Brexit is to reside in fear at the horror to come, yet to be in favour of such distaste, is no different from that which we are all assured: a very terrible time.</p><p name="991e" id="991e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First Britain. Then &lt;insert European country&gt;. Then a second and a third, until the whole thing returns back to the cultural wasteland of misfits and tyrants which made Europe its homely self. As much as we wish for coherency, peace and stability, there must come a time for it all to give way to our human desires, breeding like a swamp buried deep beneath the surface. Likewise, at some point in the distant future, Britain will once again rejoin and leave the EU, following the ritual cull we call war.</p><p name="40f7" id="40f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the same as it ever was, as it ever will be, though don’t let the kool-aid bring you down. That’s why they invented Netflix, to keep the dopamine cleeeeeeeaan.</p><p name="732a" id="732a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For we will be at war, grabbing at each other’s throats as our forefathers did before us. It is not an outcome, so much as it is a process — a continued cycle we remain completely oblivious to, yet contribute vividly towards each and everyday.</p><p name="e909" id="e909" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess that’s what makes the whole thing so stunning and theatrical. With the rise of Trump and likeminded individuals, the whole spectacle can seem unreal at times, especially as we witness our safety challenged and threatened for a new name to rise above and dominate, if only to suggest that power is a goal worth believing in; a reflection of the hopelessness we all pertain.</p><p name="0edb" id="0edb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Remember this — the institution was always a privilege, a privilege we abused and slaughtered, with a belief the party was impenetrable and benign. Well, the party is over and I assure you we have returned back to reality. We are living it, no different to the rise of Hitler or the destruction of our senses on a bender we cannot recollect.</p><p name="b2b1" id="b2b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps some are too slow to feel. Too slow to grasp. Too dull to see reality for what it is.</p><p name="cb0f" id="cb0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We are all very scared.</p></div></div></section>
