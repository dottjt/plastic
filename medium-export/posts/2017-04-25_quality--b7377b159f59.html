The body readjusts.</p><p name="8550" id="8550" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have rightfully been lead to believe that my feelings are worthless, and perhaps I am correct.</p><p name="4211" id="4211" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know it’s because I hardly feel anything at all, yet it’s what helps me envision my place in society. I mean, you can almost taste the grandeur permeating through my digital byline, thick lines forming yanky around the modules decomposing pound-cake through the subtle reposition of your neck.</p><p name="aea3" id="aea3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a snake with deformed hands. It whispers softly:</p><p name="3b84" id="3b84" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You are one of us.”</p><p name="b3c1" id="b3c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see right through you, puck.</p><p name="9153" id="9153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Obviously, I am correct in the hollow deception I carry like a burden without forethought. For I am Asian Pierce Brosnan… with an exquisitely fruity twist.</p><p name="fa29" id="fa29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, I’m a young person. And like a lot of young people, having a job is no longer a luxury most of us can afford.</p><p name="3855" id="3855" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead we are taught from a young age that jobs are inherently canabalistic; this kind of feral beast that merely subsists amongst the various other scoundrel, deliberating it’s existence along the mouldy crust we congratulate as decorative aspartame.</p><p name="43c0" id="43c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yummy, yummy, so very delicieux — if it weren’t for your debt collector who knows more about your life than you do it.</p><p name="8916" id="8916" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the lucky few of us with our weary choices behind us, we have these wholesome and inappropriately titled substitute-things called ‘careers’, which are much more black and sinister than any amount of lecturing on the ethics of free-will ever could be.</p><p name="817e" id="817e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With a career you no longer become confined to the petty separation between work, life and leisure.</p><p name="7e2e" id="7e2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead it all blurs into a disgusting husk of pre-worn fabric, flouted without dopamine or sex appeal — a candid reminder that your body just ain’t up for the 5:50am sludge through the dissipating remains of a rotting corpse.</p><p name="a93f" id="a93f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It moves with the motion that carries you towards your deathbed.</p><p name="3e78" id="3e78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under your career you now become subject to a wide range of exhaustive abuse that you learn to love and cherish.</p><p name="2856" id="2856" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s almost, almost.</p><p name="577c" id="577c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The march without the chant. A lossless conspiracy that consumes as much as it preaches. I’ve become so absolutely encompassed by my application, to a point where it’s no longer considered polite to both breathe and smile at the same time. I barely even know who I am <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anymore</em>.</p><p name="87bd" id="87bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The scarcity is beautiful, they say.</p><p name="ada3" id="ada3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I would agree.</p><p name="b4a6" id="b4a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, this is what I’ve been lead to idolise and the tricky thing about it all is that unlike a lot of my peers, I’m actually surviving.</p><p name="6e58" id="6e58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because I urge you to please not be mistaken. This is purely survival we’re talking about here and I will rip another man’s jaw off if it means my table will shine brighter than the table next to me, when my soul becomes available for auction to the next highest available bidder.</p><p name="e10d" id="e10d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After all, this is mental health on steroids.</p><p name="a632" id="a632" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My purpose is nothing more than pure, unadulterated, honest ambition — transpiring itself into a modal tune of frequent exercise, healthy reflection and wistful charity, because I am the moral equivalent of a Bolivian trust fund.</p><p name="98e3" id="98e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I am doing is right.</p><p name="01a2" id="01a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s what the Government wants. It’s what society wants. It’s what my parents probably would have wanted, given the amount of drugs I’ve taken and laundered, to despise what the anti-careerists have been meandered for decades.</p><p name="c5cc" id="c5cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hope.</p><p name="3e71" id="3e71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And my gosh, have I never been more hopeful in my entire life, as I crack open a beer and glass my wife.</p><p name="a22a" id="a22a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose there’s a very broken quality to my personality that both elaborates itself into the sickness permeating through my brain, as well as through the kind, neurological trickle, delegating it’s frittle rub against my premonition, like a prince gallantly marching towards war.</p><p name="23cc" id="23cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No, no.</p><p name="fde7" id="fde7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not amnesia.</p><p name="86aa" id="86aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s nothing inappropriately sexy about forgetting how to tie your shoelaces, and certainly there’s a stature being held back here that wants to rip my face off and surround me with resounding empathy.</p><p name="62c6" id="62c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My problem is that I’m greedy with hope and ambition, and I don’t know when to stop.</p><p name="08f2" id="08f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because when I want something, I work hard at it, and I don’t stop until I have it.</p><p name="4504" id="4504" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m blinded by the journey and I couldn’t imagine it any other way.</p><p name="5398" id="5398" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">*places gun to head*</p></div></div></section>
