Almost deliberate, wouldn’t you?</p><p name="5472" id="5472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She was beautiful. Even I knew that. Her hair was as quaint as the rearranged colours of our afternoon sky, curled into a hurricane of mesmerising elegance. At least I’m sure that’s what my mind thought as it raced through my beating heart, slaughtering all comprehension to an irregular tick. The dress was white, cloud as cloud will be. Well, of course it was white, but as to where it came from was a mystery. Certainly, a mystery repressed into carelessness, eluding all thought and preparation.</p><p name="2f31" id="2f31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then of course there was me, prodding around in a black plaid suit with a shitty bow-tie. I highly doubt anyone recognised me. The surrounding judgement and false smiles were simply undeserving of my half-shaken routine. Vindicated like a cheap oil, I hauled myself into the corner for refined restitution. Soggy moulding biscuit. My pride remained unacquainted within a pile of trash, later to be fought over as a gift for the homeless.</p><p name="e1ad" id="e1ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Really, marriage has become more of an obligation than a ceremony, sort of like travelling overseas to populate your Facebook page with new and vague pop-culture. Oh look, here’s a picture dating back to 1987 of me holding an endangered orangutan. Listen, between you and me it was an extra $200 to to kill the damn thing, though I couldn’t quite tell if the keeper was joking or not.</p><p name="aede" id="aede" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He certainly didn’t get a tip from me.</p><p name="9e84" id="9e84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was something jarring in the way she communicated herself through the lace veil covering her soft features. Behind the white citrus vogue was a devil awaiting to be freed. Perhaps it was part of her refusal to remain human, as her hellish horns shone an effervescent red through the manic anger beaming from her eyes.</p><p name="ca0a" id="ca0a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who knows, maybe it was in my best interest to keep her as a pet, feeding the devil part of my soul as reprimand for forgetting to buy milk on those odd occasions I were sober. The truth is, I really shouldn’t have spoken.</p><p name="5d45" id="5d45" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Well, no one likes your shitty wet chandy. It’s fucking terrible and it hurts my eyes. Placid without the love! Why don’t you care? LOVE ME!? WHY IS IT JUST SO FUCKING HARD TO LOVE ME!!!”</p><p name="c04b" id="c04b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I looked into her eyes, I could tell the struggle was real. I wasn’t sure who wanted it less. You’d think in some cute sort of way we could just bash each other senselessly until one of us would wake up from this horrible dream. I’d hit her. She’d hit me. Then we’d awkwardly smile as our respective parents argued in silence over who was more deserving of the pain.</p><p name="94b2" id="94b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe, quite secretly, she wanted to see the whole thing burn, just as I probably subconsciously had too. Passionless love has been known to solve just about anything, even death in some unforgiving circumstances. Flickering in pale misery, the realisation had struck me that immortality would not come cheap. I mean, it’s not a fucking video game man. You can’t just reset this shit.</p><p name="6adb" id="6adb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though maybe it was real. Maybe she loved me. Maybe I was just an idiot with an unevolved sense of crime.</p><p name="abbd" id="abbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We both kissed each other and cried.</p><p name="0677" id="0677" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It was beautiful.</p></div></div></section>
