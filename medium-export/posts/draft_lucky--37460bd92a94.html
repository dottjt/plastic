Lucky enough at the very least, to be expressing these feelings without the whimsical or pertinent touch of deliberate sarcastic euphoria.  </p><p name="86de" id="86de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Life has been a pretty humbling experience so far. Like a hollowed shell discovering it’s self-mutilated catharsis for the very first time, there have been numerous highs and lows to celebrate. All completely acidic; cherry candy warp. And even as it  continues to dig it’s sharp heels into my  soft exterior, I can personally sense my own window  of  freedom opening beyond the horizon. </p><p name="e6f3" id="e6f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The window of hope that drapes our souls and brings light to our perception. </p><p name="599c" id="599c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Certainly, it’s not been the cookie-cutter experience of acceptance and self-forgiveness us humans have always  hoped for in some form, but that’s ultimately okay because I am human and these are human problems we must all face. Hopefully, with a keen sense of purpose and awareness. </p><p name="7f00" id="7f00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we all know, self-acceptance is a curious beast. A powerful force which displays no mercy, tolerance, nor pleasure from your indifference. One which continues to humble and impress, like the thought of an expensive hooker which understands only your own language. </p><p name="b590" id="b590" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wanted to write this piece as a formal declaration of my existence. Because that’s something I’m okay with, and something which I think needs to be addressed and acknowledged.</p><p name="c454" id="c454" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although it’s been a very tumultuous year; rapid in  change and fast in it’s unrelenting pace, I’ve come to appreciate that this is simply the way life is meant to be lived. Change is what brings wealth and without wealth, you have nothing. </p><p name="7f84" id="7f84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what’s changed? I’m glad you asked!</p><p name="8086" id="8086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, I just had an offer accepted on a house the other day, which has been a very exciting development. If you haven’t yet thought about buying a house, it’s a lot like dating and if you haven’t yet dated, then you’re in for a world of pain. </p><p name="820d" id="820d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depending on your budget, you&#39;ll almost always get outbid by someone else, which is to say that the house simply wasn’t for you, not that you didn’t deserve the house. However, much like dating, something that’s the right fit will always eventually come along, which often means being at the right place at the right time.</p><p name="0215" id="0215" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My partner and I got very, very lucky. There was a property we liked, we went on the day and fell in-love with the place. The agent expressed that the owner were looking for short settlement and so once we’d inspected in the place, I decided to be assertive and so I put a price on the table and said in order for us to meet that settlement, we’ll need to move quickly. We signed an expression on interest right there and then, and a few hours later we’d heard that they’d accepted the offer! </p><p name="6128" id="6128" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately, we got very lucky and this is not how house buying plays out at all in the slightest. In almost every case you get caught up in a bidding war and it becomes an absolute nightmare — especially when others have leverage over you. </p><p name="ffbf" id="ffbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, the best part of this story is that we got this incredible house for a reasonable price, and although we were nowhere near the highest offer, we were the right fit in terms of what they required. </p><p name="4f75" id="4f75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, no different to dating.</p><p name="19d5" id="19d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I’ve only expressed the good side to that story, ultimately the whole ordeal has been an incredibly stressful process. We probably put in bids for around 10 properties — and we’re talking strong bids and  </p><p name="0e0c" id="0e0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A little less recently I’ve also started a new job at an amazing company. Well, at least amazing compared to where I’ve come from and perhaps, compared to any other company I’ve ever worked for. </p><p name="5d5d" id="5d5d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
