Dear Australian,

<section name="4223" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="5104" id="5104" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">austraylias.</h3><p name="9c14" id="9c14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Dear Australian, </p><p name="96d2" id="96d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am writing this today, perhaps as an automated message, in an attempt to convey thought. Hardly concise, your dribble is much-appreciated. </p><p name="2bdc" id="2bdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, this is today’s reminder to serve.</p><p name="fe0f" id="fe0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, as one of ten’s of millions of servants,  there are many different ways you may serve your country — driven by some sort of deep-seated insecurity you’ve most likely been harbouring since birth, I’m sure. </p><p name="57a9" id="57a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You may partake in constructing shelter for future or past citizens. Reassure fellow citizens by providing them with advice on how best to organise their time. Traumatise citizens in an attempt to keep said arbiters employed. Espouse bullshit and religion, ensuring citizens spend their fair share on the economy.</p><p name="024e" id="024e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The pie is truly yours for the taking. </p><p name="b573" id="b573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, it’s of vital importance that your service be of meaning, otherwise you may find yourself struggling to contribute towards this great foreign land,  owned without vagina by the Queen of England. </p><p name="aafe" id="aafe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only problem is that… well, I guess it’s a small, tiny detail that only most of us spend our entire lives trying to battle.</p><p name="68ea" id="68ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, modern society already has most of what it needs. </p><p name="7b24" id="7b24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have this incredible array of infrastructure that delivers food, water and energy across the country. I mean, you can more-or-less get a meal anywhere, provided you have sufficient credits, and even if you’re broke, for many of us there are organisations which exist (the Australian Government, for example) which can provide free credits, provided you play their game. </p><p name="2113" id="2113" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, we have so much abundance that most it goes to waste, or at the very least, trickles up into the bank accounts of our founders.</p><p name="e543" id="e543" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet the problem has never been a worry about supply, as our crusty economic  friends have been allowing. </p><p name="0b1f" id="0b1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather, it has always been an issue of meaning in Australian society, or particular demand, as if our actions are above mere survival. </p><p name="3801" id="3801" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose you could say that we’ve arrived  at the tail-end of the party, as society degrades without remorse. Our expectations are raw and plentiful, corrupting what little sense we have left in our ability to process reality. </p><p name="afb8" id="afb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So in order to organise our Australian society, we provide a number of extraneous products and services to help us create meaning, as if happiness itself were also a product to share.</p><p name="2df3" id="2df3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We have our alcohol and cigarettes. We have our advertising and marketing. We have our entertainment and social media, designed purely to keep ourselves aligned with our ‘message’ (well, we think it’s ours, however even that is a lie). </p><p name="01f4" id="01f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We consume trash in the hope of feeling indifferent about our emotions. We deavour comics and fantasy, as if life itself were some kind of touchy-feely play-thing, in an attempt to replace the lost interaction we never quite understood as a child. </p><p name="79d2" id="79d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the way we serve Australia, under a veil of sewerage and tongue, as I’m sure has infected the rest of the world. </p><p name="1d93" id="1d93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here I am, communicating behind a screen. </p><p name="2613" id="2613" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is our Australia. </p><p name="45c1" id="45c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Serve it you must. </p><p name="ca5e" id="ca5e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="adea" id="adea" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
