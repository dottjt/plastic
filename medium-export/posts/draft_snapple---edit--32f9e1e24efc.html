(edit) </h3><p name="02b2" id="02b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I witnessed a very stark realisation about my depression today that I would like to share with everyone. </p><p name="305d" id="305d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was lying in my bed in a sort of daze when it hit me. I came to the realisation that my sadness had nothing to do with my past: my joblessness, my bad breakups, my shitty childhood, my unfortunate anti-social behaviour. </p><p name="7b79" id="7b79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, not that you’re able to pin it down as you lie there, preoccupied in an excruciating churning of tantalising anxiety. Rather it’s a part of you that develops into intuition, waning into the ebbs and flows of your consciousness, striking down upon you without vice. We assume our emotions and feelings are because of who we are and our past existence, completely discounting our ability to conjure and think. </p><p name="dcf8" id="dcf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess for a tiny moment I was able to see through these silence illusions and understand that my depression was a result of my actions, rather than a consequence of their totality, laid out to be snorted in the pulsating vulnerability eating away at me. You see, the insecurity, the bad breakups, the horrible memories; all those bad memories are merely symptoms of something greater, which I would like to explain to you.  </p><p name="a6d3" id="a6d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It wasn’tnot my joblessness that’s making me sad. Rather, it’s me expecting that to get a job so easily that is making me sad, as a pile on anxiety and the narratives of how I’m unable to get a simple job that I easily qualify for. </p><p name="785e" id="785e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, what makes it so cunning is that you don’t realise this is going on, because you’re so focused on that narrative of insecurity you mask as truth, that “you’re not good enough” that “I really have to get a job or I’m screwed” and you truly believe your message, your new-found religion, to the point of going insane until you physically can’t take it anymore and you… crash and become depressed. </p><p name="a5a5" id="a5a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We chase the mania because we hope to avoid sin, only to revel in sin to cope with the hopelessness. </p><p name="628e" id="628e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of my response when I would crash would be to obsess over my first relationship, because that’s where my insecurity was strongest. I used to think that it was me being single that was making me sad, but now I’ve come to realise that it had nothing to do with her breaking up with me. Rather, it was the consequence of trying so hard to try and find “the one”, only to experience torment and excruciation instead.</p><p name="4589" id="4589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other part of the reason for my depression is that I went way overboard with my coding. I coded to the point where I physically couldn’t type anymore and obviously, I am crashing now. </p><p name="c8f1" id="c8f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Balance. That’s how you deal with these situations, because trying your best isn’t about </p><p name="6b49" id="6b49" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="d85c" id="d85c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I’ve realised is it’s HOW you deal with these situations that determine how you feel, not these situations themselves.</p><p name="1738" id="1738" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="869f" id="869f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though they are symptoms, </p><p name="821d" id="821d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a very mature realisation when you come to think of it, because the usual response in these circumstances is to lose all hope and give up. Splurge on the pantry. Obsess over a past lover. Gear up the drugs and pornography, only to disgrace yourself the next day. We use these things as scape-goats for our feelings, even though they do nothing to gratify us of our insecurity. </p><p name="6ad2" id="6ad2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I continued to lay there in my haze, thinking about my actions rather than these stupid little excuses, and I now know part of the reason I got depressed was because I pushed myself too hard. </p><p name="01ca" id="01ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it’s important that we talk about these things, otherwise we risk stigmatising those around us and cultivating a hive mind of ignorance and fear.</p><p name="a50a" id="a50a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, I’m quite lucky in that I have gained significant traction over my depression. In fact, you probably wouldn’t notice it at all. Actually, that’s hardly true. I have my days, as well all do. However for the most part, I’m motivated, productive and ambitious with what I want to achieve in life. I push myself beyond which is required and .</p><p name="b99c" id="b99c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though perhaps I am describing the problem here. I push myself too hard to the point of obsession. </p><p name="a418" id="a418" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
