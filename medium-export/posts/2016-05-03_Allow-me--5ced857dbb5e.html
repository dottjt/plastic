We season it with ice.</p><p name="acd2" id="acd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Precisely, I hate myself and these words, and it’s a bad case of good privilege making bad assumptions of the brittle world around us, desiring semblance above the clatter we taunt with a hollow vengeance.</p><p name="0c7e" id="0c7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My poorly medicated writing hands. They’re trained to extort, lie and delegate with a precious intent, searching for silence amongst a field of white and buzzing affinity. Darkness on the other hand, is a misdemeaour. Darkness is the gaping wound preoccupying my weeping heart. Darkness is the taint disgust which love chooses to abhor; we propagate as deeply as we share.</p><p name="4eca" id="4eca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We write. We grapple. We end up with a loathing so strong, an enemy so swill, that we perish without whim into the broken melody inherent within our words. Collapsing into a terrible violence, voluntarily purging the cells and biological abstractions clouding our youth; a heavy dose of subordinate cynicism wanders into the distance, bashing and tumbling against the harsh fray, singing in grave stillness to the tune of the breeze-easy.</p><p name="b025" id="b025" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Breeze-easy, they say. Though not all is lost, we say.</p><p name="02df" id="02df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I managed to beat the living shit out of a child earlier. Hell, I even attacked the mother with a crowbar. To be fair, I decided it worthy to let the daughter live… at least until I was able to gather my final breath and exhale against the chilly exterior, mentally calculating the trajectory of my fist to her skull.</p><p name="2158" id="2158" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Actually, no.</p><p name="88cd" id="88cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What really happened, was that I began writing for publication.</p><p name="5a91" id="5a91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of a dead child as a result of my inexcusable act of rage, came clarity and foster. The inner workings of my mind failed to suffocate or confuse, bringing new life to these crafty boxes of meaning; the lexicon of our dreams. I looked into the grammar, or rather, the grammar looked into me, and with a sincere metamorphosis, cried. I’m sorry dear, but I truly love you.</p><p name="0c60" id="0c60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to give this freelance thing another crack. I want to make my million, eat my cake and dissolve into a state of perpetual serenity, withering into the safety of my own words, gasping at the light guiding me towards a finer grace.</p><p name="a4b6" id="a4b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, who knows. This could just be another breakdown geared towards mania and if so, I’m basically slush.</p><p name="83e4" id="83e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My condolences. Green is back. He’s a naïve, prune liar with a glaring static in his eyes, however he’s back and there’s no doubt in my mind that his mood will once again triumph against the arrogance society calls talent.</p><p name="cf98" id="cf98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m a wreck, please leave me alone.</p><p name="ac8c" id="ac8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PS: I promise I’m actually fine, and that this exposé was merely a pretentious exercise of self-care. I am working on a couple of pieces and am excited to renounce my lack of faith, in the art I so dearly love.</p><p name="88cb" id="88cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">PSS: I can’t believe I wrote such crap.</p></div></div></section>
