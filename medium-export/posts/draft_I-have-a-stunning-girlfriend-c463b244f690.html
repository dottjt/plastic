Either one of us would experience some kind of severe emotional breakdown during the first six months of meeting up, though I think it’s normal for all relationships to experience some kind of emotional hardship.</p><p name="4820" id="4820" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve noticed that my love grows for each and every day. I didn’t experience that kind of intense euphoria of young love when we first got together.</p><p name="ea76" id="ea76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, I was rather hesitant about our relationship.</p><p name="168b" id="168b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="f23b" id="f23b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She is an amazingly kind, caring and clumsy individual.</p><p name="3d8d" id="3d8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She’s everything I’ve ever wanted, minus the creeping leg hair.</p><p name="433b" id="433b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, I thought it would be nice if she could lean a little more towards the anorexic side, though clearly my potent array of subject body image has had little effective on her eating patterns.</p><p name="cfdb" id="cfdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At least purge a little.</p><p name="4498" id="4498" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By any measures, my girlfriend is gorgeous and she has a face.</p><p name="427f" id="427f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is amplified further by her eye brows, which look like thinly painted murals</p><p name="5f71" id="5f71" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="fad8" id="fad8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">low self-esteem, but I always tell her how beautiful she is, no matter how bad I want to reach for that paper bag I keep stowed away underneath the bed.</p><p name="397f" id="397f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would describe her as a naturally luscious Kim Kardashian, with a dash of cellulite to boot.</p><p name="b395" id="b395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She has amazingly big, bright eyes. Persian eyelashes. A wide face with thick, cloying lips. Bum chin galore. She’s also incredibly fat and taller than me, though that’s okay.</p><p name="f7d7" id="f7d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I love her for who she is and I know she will age gracefully, while I’m still</p><p name="79c9" id="79c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At face value, she looks like an avid smoker (those Mediterranean lips) and has an incredible bitch voice. Deep down inside, she’s a sweet cutie.</p><p name="8e8d" id="8e8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am told she has large breasts, though it’s hard to tell when you’re stuck to fondling the same pair for over a year.</p><p name="0b12" id="0b12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It’s not just her looks. Actually, come to think about it, she sort of looks like a female version of Hercules, while I look like a male Mulan.</p></div></div></section>
