Part of you feels guilty and certainly as someone who gets attached easily; guilt manifests itself in the worst possible ways. </p><p name="ec57" id="ec57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My safari browser had decided to stop loading web pages, prompting me to switch over to the Chrome web browser which I hadn’t touched in a while (Chrome drains my macbook battery faster than Safari).</p><p name="c67c" id="c67c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Chrome, located in the favourites bar above, is a link to Tumblr.</p><figure name="b816" id="b816" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 474px; max-height: 156px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 32.9%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jv71zOo3YOsvSTadBGl4Yw.png" data-width="474" data-height="156" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jv71zOo3YOsvSTadBGl4Yw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Indeed, to the very right of your image. </figcaption></figure><p name="7d03" id="7d03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Tumblr is a dark, dark place, full of even darker people. Generally you don’t tell people you have a Tumblr, because you like cultivating your mental illness in silence, like a silk worm performing it’s duties. </p><p name="e630" id="e630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a degenerate, I used Tumblr for different two purposes. Not only to express my mental illness, however more fundamentally, to also hit on other mentally ill women. </p><p name="96cd" id="96cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Classy combination, soldier. </p><p name="dba6" id="dba6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tumblr is a lot like a mental asylum. In many ways you think it exists to protect you, when in reality, merely exaggerates your and twists your mind, as hanging around a bunch of mentally ill people usually does.  </p><p name="dd1f" id="dd1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leaving Tumblr is arguably the best thing you can do for your mental health if you indeed use it for that purpose. I am certainly glad I spent no longer in that dreary place, as difficult as it was to leave. Very rarely will Tumblr ever leave on a happy ending. </p><p name="a522" id="a522" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, I did the idiot thing and I decided to login. I mean, what’s the worst that could happen?</p><p name="c45c" id="c45c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first profile I decide to check out is of a girl I was quite fond of and I suppose, I was startled to say the least. </p><p name="104e" id="104e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s amazing to see how dramatically people’s lives can change for the worst. In the beginning she was seemingly innocent, studying engineering, working retail, you know, doing what normal people do.</p><p name="7bc5" id="7bc5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, she suffered from depression (like many do) and was in a bit of a struggle street, typical of those who do suffer from depression. </p><figure name="7354" id="7354" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 652px; max-height: 146px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 22.400000000000002%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*g7lr4NTkjDTSOskwk5ieLw.png" data-width="652" data-height="146" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*g7lr4NTkjDTSOskwk5ieLw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Your palette of disaster. </figcaption></figure><p name="c5d0" id="c5d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The moment I left Tumblr, she was playing around with the idea of webcamming as a fun, cool way to making money. As we all fantasise, webcamming is seen to be this way to be sexy, powerful, along with all the other reasons that getting paid to flash your boobs make you feel. </p><p name="22f8" id="22f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hell, even I wanted to do it, but of course the reality of webcamming is not all that it’s cracked up to be.</p><p name="a433" id="a433" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, some time later, she has REALLY gotten into webcamming and her mental state has truly deteriorated. Her traumatic responses have gotten worse. Almost all her posts are about self-harm and perhaps as a side effect of the glamorous life she was entailing: was really beginning to hate men.</p><p name="d901" id="d901" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, it wasn’t just men. She had turned from an impressionable child into someone filled with hate, rage and uncontrollable anger. </p><p name="4df4" id="4df4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless to say, I immediately closed my laptop in a sort of daze of mental illness as I tried to contain what I had just experienced.</p><p name="072a" id="072a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of why Tumblr was so bad for me was that I took everything very personally, especially other people’s mental illness. So in a way, I would use Tumblr as a way to intentionally become more mental ill (I find depression euphoric, however that’s a story for another time).</p><p name="ea23" id="ea23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It truly is the kind of spiral that I tried to avoid myself and is what drove me to leave Tumblr. </p><p name="5b70" id="5b70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet to </p><p name="4b69" id="4b69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose I learnt a few things about myself and others in that moment of exhilaration.</p><p name="43dc" id="43dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Firstly, every single decision you make builds your character, regardless of whether you think your actions are harmless or otherwise. </p><p name="2f14" id="2f14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that’s why I’m so grateful I left Tumblr. I knew it was a step in the right direction, even if it was difficult.</p><p name="71da" id="71da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ghadi expresses my sentiment more succinctly:</p><blockquote name="3148" id="3148" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Your beliefs become your thoughts, <br>Your thoughts become your words, <br>Your words become your actions, <br>Your actions become your habits, <br>Your habits become your values, <br>Your values become your destiny.”</blockquote><p name="d6b6" id="d6b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Come to think of it, my entire life is about letting go of the things that hold you down and for many with depression, learning to let go is the most difficult thing you can do.</p><p name="cc4f" id="cc4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By leaving Tumblr, not only was I leaving all the emotional support I was receiving from others, however it also felt to a large extent that I was losing my voice.</p><p name="f7bd" id="f7bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The one place where I could vent and be mentally ill and almost be accepted for that. Not to mention, it was the only platform I’d ever had success with women, so in my mind, it also meant throwing away my aspiration for having a girlfriend, which was part of my insecurity.</p><p name="2689" id="2689" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the otherhand however, leaving Tumblr </p><p name="6f91" id="6f91" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="67f4" id="67f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you go down a naught path, the naughty will come to get you. </p><p name="1bc6" id="1bc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Secondly, learning to relax and let go is one of the most important things you can do for yourself. </p><p name="2dda" id="2dda" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="aeb7" id="aeb7" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
