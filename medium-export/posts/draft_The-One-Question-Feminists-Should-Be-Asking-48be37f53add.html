We are living in the feminist world and yes, the issue I imagine is that it’s not quite what feminists thought it would be. </p><p name="dbc0" id="dbc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the funny thing about success. </p><p name="2b22" id="2b22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Success is not the idealistic haven that we’ve adopted in the moral literature of our movements: It is the subtle reality of accomplishment, either for better or worse. </p><p name="6ce3" id="6ce3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s sort of like when Obama was elected into office. There was all this craze and hype about hope and change, when in reality, things more-or-less stayed the same. </p><p name="02f9" id="02f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is because social movements don’t define who we are as human beings. As human beings, we need to eat and work to earn our keep. As human beings, we need to get along and co-operate to build this society and yet seemingly, we now get along less than ever before. </p><p name="dd25" id="dd25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Often movements are limited by tradition and in the case of feminism, what happened was no different to any other social movement: Opposition formed and anti-feminism spiralled in response. </p><p name="a7c0" id="a7c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The great, over-resounding irony of feminism, much like all progressive ideologies, is that they revolve around this idea of intellectual domination, in-spite of the fact that they spout equality.</p><p name="3890" id="3890" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Equality and ideological authoritarianism do not mix. In the world of feminism, there is no room for democracy. Of course, not understanding what feminism was always destined to become, feminists tried to create debate. </p><p name="a5ac" id="a5ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What resulted was a fragmentation of feminism to the point that no one really knows what it is. In Christina Hoff Sommers book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Stole_Feminism%3F" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Stole_Feminism%3F" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Who Stole Feminism?</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>she argues that (Wikipedia summary):</p><blockquote name="50ea" id="50ea" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“there is a split within American feminism between what she called ‘equity feminism’ and ‘gender feminism’. Sommers contends that equity feminists seek equal legal rights for women and men, while gender feminists seek to counteract historical inequalities based on gender.”</blockquote><p name="fc00" id="fc00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Some 20 years later, this is not inclusive of the hundreds of different variations of feminism that have arisen, such as inter-sectional feminism and ecofeminism. </p><p name="6991" id="6991" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However the issue runs much deeper. I would argue that the reason why feminism hasn’t turned out as hope is because of the internet: the embodiment of human democratisation; a global forum which does not adhere to domination of thought. </p><p name="00c6" id="00c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anti-feminist publications such as Breitbart has more than 1.4 million Facebook followers, as well as thousands of websites, blogs and forums - all expressing the discontent of feminism and it’s influence on society. </p><p name="a364" id="a364" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="60ff" id="60ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understandably feminism had good intentions, however I would argue that it has no place in the 21st century. </p><p name="7dc2" id="7dc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are currently in an age of technology where economic and social repression are being neutered. If you have the right ideas, you can do amazing things and feminism is not one of them. </p><p name="5d8c" id="5d8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Feminism didn’t build Facebook. Feminism didn’t build Twitter or Medium. </p><p name="0319" id="0319" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In fact, all social movements do until they </p><p name="e430" id="e430" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"> initially, ranging from economic socialism to sovereign liberation. You have an initial struggle and then you win.</p><p name="5fbb" id="5fbb" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
