In a way, I see those described limitations as a challenge to allow the best and brightest to push themselves forward and exceed with profound clarity.</p><p name="7e2c" id="7e2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arguably, the most wanky thing I have ever written. Well, at least as today is concerned.</p><p name="59da" id="59da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given more perspective however, at least in trying to integrate seemingly into a “normal” almost heinously traditional life, I think I have come to respect that it’s not because I’m a millennial, rather, that it’s fucking difficult for everyone.</p><p name="5a62" id="5a62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I put off working for a very long time. It wasn’t until I was 19 when I got my first casual position and even then, I hated working more than 10 times a week.</p><p name="293a" id="293a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I viewed work as a necessary evil. That thing we are forced into doing.</p></div></div></section>
