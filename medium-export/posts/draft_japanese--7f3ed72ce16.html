In part so you can better understand in layman’s terms why it’s such a bastard to learn, because it’s something that hasn’t quite become  apparent to me until recently. </p><p name="5a03" id="5a03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And you know, now that I know why it’s difficult, it’s really helped me refine my approach towards language learning in general. Oh, and in order to do this I will compare Japanese with typical romance languages; let’s say French for the sake of this article. </p><p name="741e" id="741e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the case of something like French, which is a relatively similar language to English, what can be insanely effective is using the Listening-Reading method  which allows you to essentially blitz through the whole process; which allowed me to develop a fairly solid grasp of Italian within the space of a few days.</p><p name="50a1" id="50a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ultimately it relies on utilising parallel texts along  with accompanying audio in order to ingrain a language into your brain, and it’s truly fantastic. You can grasp a language very, very quickly without having to memorize a single thing.</p><p name="d40c" id="d40c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re interested in learning more, it’s detailed quite vividly in this link:</p><blockquote name="5ca6" id="5ca6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><a href="http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm" data-href="http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://users.bestweb.net/~siom/martian_mountain/!%20L-R%20the%20most%20important%20passages.htm</a></blockquote><p name="ee2c" id="ee2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Now, this works really well with languages which are highly similar, such as English and French, however I’ll try and explain why it doesn’t work with something like Japanese, at all. </p><ul class="postList"><li name="0dcc" id="0dcc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Japanese sentence and grammar  structure is effectively the opposite of something like French and English, which is to say that your Japanese-English parallel texts will not match up at all; and the whole premise of the Listening-Reading method is that you can simply follow along with the text and create basic associations between the different languages. </li><li name="d9a8" id="d9a8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Assuming you can magically get past this hurdle without it affecting your ability to learn, it’s also  phonetically impossible to actually know to pronounce a   character based on it’s kanji, without also having a   hiragana translation present as well. Which is to say you will need to separately learn the sound of the language phonetically, along with how to actually write it.</li><li name="42cd" id="42cd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">This is further compounded by the fact that there are so few sounds within the language to begin with, and so pronunciation along is not enough to know what is being said. You must also understand </li></ul><p name="63a3" id="63a3" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--li"><br></p><p name="92fb" id="92fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, even if you did manage to have all that information, the Listening-Reading method would no longer be effective because you’ll now have far too much information to manage. </p><p name="08de" id="08de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the case of English and French, all you effectively have to grasp is the sound of the language, because there’s a strong correlation between the sound of the language and the ability to write it; meaning that by learning how to speak the language, you can effectively learn how to write it as well. It honestly is that simple, which is why it doesn’t take very long to learn something like French. </p><p name="0300" id="0300" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the case of Japanese however, in effect , which mind you may or may not use kanji or hiragana; depending on how it is chosen to be expressed. </p><p name="72c2" id="72c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, this isn’t even the beginning of why the language is actually difficult to learn. These are merely hiccups to the learning process. </p><p name="4483" id="4483" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real reason why Japanese is difficult is because it is a language that is purely based on context, which is impossible to gather for the above two reasons. </p><p name="8281" id="8281" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, let’s say you hear the </p><p name="7e67" id="7e67" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="fa59" id="fa59" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="d389" id="d389" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, this isn’t even the real reason why Japanese is so difficult. </p><p name="1624" id="1624" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="9300" id="9300" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="4369" id="4369" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
