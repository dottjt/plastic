Swipe right to fuck. Oh, I was never too bright with my tinder game. </p><p name="360d" id="360d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In many ways, the internet is one of the 21st century’s greatest ironies. On the one hand, it allows for greater connectivity between individuals, yet in a way that is inherent anti-social and anti-community.</p><p name="33c6" id="33c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all plea and beg for each other’s attention, simply due to the static nature of the internet. It is not like a nature conversation, so much that our messages exist as memes for the mind to absorb. </p><p name="3fc7" id="3fc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We attract others by projecting our personality out to the world and if people like what they see, they follow, like, share, you name it. It is in this sense that we either absorb or give ourselves up. </p><p name="5269" id="5269" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Community is about co-operation, whereas the internet, like all things, has merely emphasised centralisation on a mass scale. It is like Jesus on steroids and my gosh, Aldous Huxley’s greatest fears have come true. </p><p name="be3f" id="be3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Arguably it is because the internet lacks the technological methods to change human nature. We are still all freaks for celebrity. We all feel a religious need to worship. </p><p name="ea8c" id="ea8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a one-way, delayed, synchronous perspective that most curiously has brought out the worst in all of us. </p><p name="54a9" id="54a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon we find ourselves projecting even harder and on a global scale, depression and mental illness ensue. </p><p name="a2da" id="a2da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose what astounds me the most is how intricate the internet has truly become. I mean, I was flicking through snapchat when I noticed that there were other channels provided by some of the world’s biggest providers such as Buzzfeed and MTV, and as I was watching their animations, I felt as if I was traversing through the projections of a million different people.</p><p name="e05a" id="e05a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is their world I am entering and to get that close to the way another person thinks, is beyond the depth of these words. </p><p name="ab83" id="ab83" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the kind of crap (well, it’s all crap I say) people fill their minds with, each and every day.</p><p name="bc34" id="bc34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, people try to look at trends as if it means to assure us about the state of humanity</p><p name="64e5" id="64e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I mean, none of us are really engaged with what we’re doing and yet this content, the people on twitter we follow, the news outlets we read </p></div></div></section>
