Inquisition and arrest.</p><p name="01dd" id="01dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your eyes dart endlessly across the room, reverberating from the words you refuse to believe. They echo in your mind. Your teacher as returned home after all these years.</p><p name="6e55" id="6e55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sinister man is watching you. He’s teaching you fear, accusing you of your own senses.</p><p name="a708" id="a708" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It hurts to fail, dripping insensate like a leaky deposit of sundered memories. You run into the kitchen, forcing your hand into the draw. With a sharp knife, you scream at the body staring you dead in the eye; covered lawless in unwise blood.</p><p name="5a38" id="5a38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Challenging your menial senselessness, you scrape at your body like a dead man trying to catch his son. It chops and bites and yet the feeling is never quite enough to remove yourself from the hatred eating into you.</p><p name="4205" id="4205" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You bite deep into your fingers, ripping them off with a single lunge, panting at the exposed bone that you repeated throw into the wall.</p><p name="8e8a" id="8e8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The screaming. The stupidity. The hard wall famously bankrupting your attempts at renewed complication, as you hit yourself with a kind of profanity that even the insane never dare enter</p><p name="0d76" id="0d76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sharp knife shatters into your bone; fragmenting the stainless steel into your supple flesh. You manically slide the broken blade across your tongue, severing it into an array of incomprehensible flesh.</p><p name="ed7c" id="ed7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You believe every word he says.</p><p name="3d69" id="3d69" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I” “love” “myself”.</p><p name="5a74" id="5a74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Mindlessly like forcing the words into your head; chaff abruption along the thin river of pain. In a sullen daze; pretending to laugh, pretending to care.</p><p name="a6bc" id="a6bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s there, in the distance.</p><p name="6c18" id="6c18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your pupils immediately shrink, the visceral burn beginning to take over. Bubbling. Crying. A thick reminder to the scars covered deep in your shame.</p><p name="3030" id="3030" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you remember her hanging, dangling like the little piece of shit you are?</p><p name="abef" id="abef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You open your mouth and you cry. You cry from the pain, you cry as a way to escape from the laughter you pretended was real.</p><p name="47f3" id="47f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I will have to stop here.</p><p name="8bb7" id="8bb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t think I can write anymore, I’m going insane trying to piece the narrative and trauma together in my head.</p><p name="266d" id="266d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I love it, but fuck me.</p><p name="7746" id="7746" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, I have a difficult time feeling. I’m a ragdoll of emotion and I love the challenge of character. I never know quite what to feel and at times, trying to express myself can feel like watching two homeless men beat the shit out of each other.</p><p name="6ea6" id="6ea6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I need a break.</p></div></div></section>
