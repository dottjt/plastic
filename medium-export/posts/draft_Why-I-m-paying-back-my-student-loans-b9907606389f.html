The lack of requirements is more-or-less morally fucked.) </p><p name="dd6c" id="dd6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, sure. Our university educaiton is no free lunch in the park, however the laws are incredibly forgiving the point where most people neglect their student loans forever and fail to worry about the consequences. Quite seriously, no one really cares and neither did I.</p><p name="0a6b" id="0a6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As is typical of most people, I’d racked up just over $20,000 in debt in the wake of completing my &lt;insert pointless university degree&gt;.</p><p name="fbae" id="fbae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Actually, it was a Bachelor of Journalism. </p><p name="dd1e" id="dd1e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like most art degrees, completely worthless, though in all honesty, valuable in today’s professional world that won’t even consider you unless if you have a piece of paper. </p><p name="f87f" id="f87f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Listen, if you’re going to get a degree, you may as well get something cheap and durable, to which I have no regrets.</p><p name="8677" id="8677" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Essentially, it enabled me to land my current writing job in Public Relations and so I suppose it all worked out in the end (though for most part, most people end up working at Grill’d for the rest of their lives). </p><p name="23c5" id="23c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was thinking recently about whether I should pay back my student loans and I couldn’t quite think of a reason why. I mean, the debt only increases roughly 3% each year, which I’m sure you means nothing in the long term (in actual fact, it means that your debt doubles every 23 years, which is terrifying).  </p><p name="75cf" id="75cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more I thought about it however, the more I realised that paying it off is probably one of the best things I could be doing. </p><p name="94bc" id="94bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s not that it’s a financially amazing investment (in many ways, it’s a horrible investment) however for myself, it was more than just creating a piece of mind. </p><p name="672d" id="672d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Put simply, in Australia, I am not legally required to pay back my student loans unless if I earn more than $54,126 per year (with which the requirement increases each year), to which you pay back 4% of your total income towards.</p><p name="7b09" id="7b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is essentially why most people don’t pay their loans back. They simply don’t think they are going to earn more than that, which I think is toxic.</p><p name="c78d" id="c78d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The reason why I’m paying back my student loans voluntarily, is because I want to wholly acknowledge that I will be earning more than $54,000 over in the very near future.</p><p name="4a63" id="4a63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I thought about it this way, paying backing my student loans made sense, more as a motivator for my future.  </p><p name="9d7c" id="9d7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Australia is not the easiest place on earth. </p></div></div></section>
