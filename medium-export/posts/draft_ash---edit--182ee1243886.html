Fuck em’ you asinine dipshit. </p><p name="2ce0" id="2ce0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Poorly formed and falling apart. I wouldn’t quite describe myself as weak. Feeling too much can hardly be described as a weakness, though I can see your point Doctor. Yes, I have been taking my medicine doctor. No doctor, I guess I see it more as a pity technique, kinda like when you’re in the VR world, allowing me to conjure description within the insecure magnificence begging me to march forward and slaughter the young children at the park. No doctor, I do not have life insurance though I promise that’s on the table, really to be served. </p><p name="95ae" id="95ae" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Oh yes, I could totally see myself using those words in a off-handed resume or a short biography.” </p><p name="1642" id="1642" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though perhaps it’s not the words I’m struggling with. Maybe it’s the people I’m beginning to despise. Come to think about it, I may not even be a person at all. Maybe I’m a just hollow shell of crass inevitability, arising above from a grave unfamiliar with its own existence. It was a simple plan, you know. I would rise and you would shut the fuck up. A delicate lie to keep our dreams alive. Clearly.</p><p name="17ec" id="17ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, I’m lucky not to be insane. Even though I appear to be, I’m sure it’s just some galactic ruse to confound the way I feel about myself. In the lingering hunger is myself; a symptom of modern attitudes and disgraceful marketing. The mess in my thoughts is mesmerising, streaking along my face and cutting into my flesh, to expose the underlying disease eating me from the inside. </p><p name="26d2" id="26d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of me feel stuck. Apparently, good isn’t good enough. Apparently, there comes a time in every man’s life where the buzzing and excitement is merely a forethought to the credentials underlying my suffering. Here I am in the midst of a mid-life crisis, examining the crumbs which I have created from the beat-up nervousness sparkling from my lips. </p><p name="c926" id="c926" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No, instead it takes courage to accept the scarcity and misfortunate not even your closest memories seem willing to accommodate.</p><p name="4b0e" id="4b0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s something inherently broken with this economy, or rather, the people floundering in it. I often wonder whether it’s just me, or if the world is truly going insane, spiralling in glitter and hard attitudes towards an almost unrecognisable death. I’m not quite sure anymore, though it helps the thoughts to imagine. </p><p name="163d" id="163d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finance, this behemoth of sunken distraught, has created a new era of try-hard wannabes with thick pockets and dreary accents. Maybe I’ve grown cynical. Certainly, I am no economist. </p><p name="05b3" id="05b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps I have been lying to myself for too long and for too well. Perhaps that’s what it takes to survive in the cruel and unforgiving reminders we post to ourselves everyday. “You’ll make it sonny boy. Just don’t forget where you came from,” as the children marched off into the machine-gun fire, suckling on the fragments of nostalgia ripping into their skulls, wrapped deep in cushion and young terror. </p><p name="2042" id="2042" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Surely I cannot be the only one, the only person out there who is entirely distraught at the prospect of gainful employment. Hell, I often question the purpose of sitting in an office, behaving excessively in an uncontrollable rage. </p><p name="f241" id="f241" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s that damn liquidity,” I tell myself, head shaking in electronic disbelief.</p><p name="fa7e" id="fa7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a fine reduction you have there. First, the soup is prepared, then given a name. Something glamourous, I assume. “White women with chunky vegetable arms.” The soldiers dig in and the craze begins to take hold; the killing quite solid. There’s a rifle under every bed and a soul awaiting in the trenches. </p><p name="33ea" id="33ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I love you Romeo, you battered soul. Come dine with me and flourish in the wind. You are my love. My only desire. </p><p name="2935" id="2935" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You are my pretend. </p><p name="7076" id="7076" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
