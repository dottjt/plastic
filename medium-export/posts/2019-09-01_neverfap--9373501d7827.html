I don’t really care what others think about it. It’s simply an aspect of my past which dominated a large portion of my life, and which is a huge, unspoken problem in society today.</p><p name="4068" id="4068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is based on the thousands of people I’ve talked to over the past 8 months, not to mention based on my own friendships and even colleagues who vocally express the daily usage of porn as something ‘normal’.</p><p name="073d" id="073d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And hey, I’m totally cool with that.</p><p name="f3c5" id="f3c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps it can help to understand that I’m the kind of person who wakes up at 5:30am each day in order to study, and who takes cold showers, eats Paleo, intermittent fasts, weight lifts etc.</p><p name="2f5d" id="2f5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I simply couldn’t stop. I mean, it’s something that I’d been doing since I was 11 years old. It was a behaviour that had literally been hardwired into my brain from the very moment I could masturbate.</p><p name="c96d" id="c96d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I absolutely hated it. I hated the guilt of hiding my habit from my partner, and the way it made me view women. I hated the feeling of dependence and helplessness it created. I hated every single thing about it.</p><p name="4af8" id="4af8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But then one day it all changed.</p><p name="1af8" id="1af8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through much attrition, a former colleague finally convinced me to try meditation and like a series of lightbulbs shattering into the distance, it finally all made sense.</p><blockquote name="1d1f" id="1d1f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">For the first time in my life, I’d discovered a way to sustainably develop control over my mind.</blockquote><p name="d4af" id="d4af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">And I knew within that moment of clarity, that I would never masturbate or watch porn ever again and as of writing this today, it’s been more than 300+ days of effortless not doing that.</p><p name="49d6" id="49d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few months following this discovery, I decided to create to create a platform to help people explore these same ideas in order to help them overcome their own porn addiction.</p><blockquote name="c3a1" id="c3a1" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">You can learn more about it at <a href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/" data-href="https://neverfapdeluxe.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://neverfapdeluxe.com/</a></blockquote><p name="64ef" id="64ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Now, while I could outline what I managed to achieve in terms of the hundreds of articles I wrote, or how I managed to build an extensive online network to assist more than 700+ porn addicts.</p><p name="2bcf" id="2bcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think it will be more meaningful to share what I personally learnt and discovered throughout this process.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="af70" id="af70" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I learnt how to build a scalable content API that could reliably serve JSON content to websites, mobile applications and even be exported to ePub and PDF format!</li><li name="11e0" id="11e0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt so much about how to build large Elixir Applications including an extensive comments system, an email subscription system, a payment platform and so much more.</li><li name="cb1d" id="cb1d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt how to build and deploy mobile applications, in both React Native and full native Android. Not to mention, I developed my first Chrome application as well.</li><li name="ef6a" id="ef6a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt how to effectively market and promote an online business, gaining more than 900+ members as part of r/NeverFapDeluxe and developing tens of thousands of page views as a result.</li><li name="7a00" id="7a00" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt how to develop effective content and SEO strategies, in addition to social media content strategies.</li><li name="b532" id="b532" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt and developed new ways to meditate to assist those who struggle with meditation via the <a href="https://tryhovering.com" data-href="https://tryhovering.com" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hovering Meditation Method</a>.</li><li name="208c" id="208c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt how to record, script and produce effective guided meditations. I also recorded a bi-weekly podcast as well.</li><li name="59d3" id="59d3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt how to build an extensive accountability and chatbot system to assist people with the porn addiction recovery process.</li><li name="8855" id="8855" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt the value of consistent, hard work as an irreplaceable aspect of success.</li><li name="59e0" id="59e0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt how to curate, develop and moderate vibrant communities of individuals. I mean, you wouldn’t believe the amount of drama I had to deal with.</li><li name="4dc7" id="4dc7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I learnt how to design logos and create brand guidelines and everything!</li></ul><p name="d1e9" id="d1e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">And that really only covers a fraction of the day-to-day of running and building NeverFap Deluxe.

Why am I writing this post?</p><p name="ec9f" id="ec9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, I’ve decided to put a Hiatus on NeverFap Deluxe in order to pursue other endeavours. It’s a complicated story, and you can read more about it on my latest <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/29605334" data-href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/29605334" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon post</a>.</p><p name="4038" id="4038" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless, as a result of my efforts on NeverFap Deluxe, I have decided to pursue Machine Learning and Data Science instead!</p><p name="c078" id="c078" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had a bit of an epiphany in regards to how best I can help porn addicts and I believe the answer lies in Machine Learning and Data Science applications. I have a lot of different ideas, but I believe it will be much more fruitful than a simple information website.</p><p name="d45c" id="d45c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, it’s been a fantastic journey to say the least, and the learnings have been considerable.</p><p name="dab5" id="dab5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Furthermore, I have some fantastic templates and processes in place for my next big endeavour, so it truly has set me up for success later down the line.</p></div></div></section>
