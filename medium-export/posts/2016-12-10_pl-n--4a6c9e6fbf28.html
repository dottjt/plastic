Sit down and smell the roses. Every sangle won of them, you foward-fuck.</p><p name="ed40" id="ed40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t like my brain and my brain don’t like me. You know, it’s sort of a refreshing tease to be able to write with a veneer of tarnish and convex. I don’t often get the opportunity to express myself often, because often there is often nothing too often to often express at all very often.</p><p name="e2da" id="e2da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I am sitting at my desk.</p><p name="d72c" id="d72c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhat robotic like. Reading, usually. Consuming informaiton. Building the information highway. Recruiting. Like a really efficient humpty-dump. Learning. Pruning. Distracting. Spiders everywhere, spinning their web around my fuckin’ I don’t know wat you call it.</p><p name="76e1" id="76e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t quite know if I regret the path I’ve taken. Certainly, it will help me get what I want, which should be good for the kids. Gotta love the kids — those invisible things that don’t quite exist yet, yet somehow extrude this enormous influence on my actions (and reducers HA HA, redux tard). \</p><p name="6a0e" id="6a0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Plan. I have a plan. Well, it’s been my plan for a while now and I would say it’s a pretty good one, if I may.</p><p name="d5ed" id="d5ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gonna become a programmer. Single Page Applications. Gonna get paid. Gonna become an internet person. Disappear completely. Detach myself from the fabric and stain, stain, stain.</p><p name="cc2e" id="cc2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Y ou want my stain? You gotta pay.</p><p name="15d8" id="15d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But you know, today is like… my break period. Where I break my emotions and spread them across a series of words, forming sentences, luxurious golden, to maintain this stupid fucking head awake. Anyway, the plan. The plan is all about growth. SOmething. I don’t fuckign know.</p><p name="a1d6" id="a1d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m really, really, really, really fucking focused, usually most of the time. I wake up at 6am and I study. Man, it’s all I actually do. I study. I read (study reading, of course). Have I broken down? Am I actually a broken man? Someone please tell me.</p><p name="a4fa" id="a4fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes.</p><p name="64a9" id="64a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I spend a lot of time building my application and it’s absolutely terrifying. I have literally zero fucking idea what I’m doing, and the more I get done, the more lost I become and the more it becomes this intricate game of survival between me, myself and the insanity that pursues.</p><p name="226c" id="226c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The arrogance of thinking it’s possible. That’s what gets you through it. So I’m going to get through it. I feel like I’m nowhere near where I need to be, but at the same time I feel like I’m much farther along than most people. Someone please explain! There’s a rabid donkey attacking me1!!.</p><p name="325a" id="325a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, and have you seen my body lately? It looks great. I didn’t know people could look this great. I have pecks, but they sort of look fake breasts. I’m going to have to consult my surgeon about that. It’s a lot of hard work. A lot of forcing yourself to buckle down and get clean.</p><p name="e7b7" id="e7b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have to. I don’t know why, but I have to. Otherwise my kids will hate me, and realise what a fucking sham I am. Wow.</p><p name="c81a" id="c81a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fuck, this sucks. Writing sucks. It’s like I want to be held, or something. Blind fold me and drug fuck me. You can’t burn what you can’t touch. So touch me. Please.</p><p name="d087" id="d087" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It’ll pass.</p></div></div></section>
