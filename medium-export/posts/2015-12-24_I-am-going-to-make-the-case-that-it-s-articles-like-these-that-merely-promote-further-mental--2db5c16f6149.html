This idea of “why bother living?” pops into your head and you can’t quite get it out. It engulfs you and in return, you feel helpless. Completely natural, you’d think.</p><p name="1422" id="1422" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In your desperation you try to seek answers to lull this seemingly taught problem. You think, “what could make life worth living?” and in your *deep introspection* you come up with an answer.</p><p name="0261" id="0261" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However consider this.</p><p name="c327" id="c327" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">None of these narratives are real, neither problem nor solution. While they may FEEL real, that is the illusion of the mind that you have learnt since birth. They are just silly thoughts that tempt us to believe, only because we’re none the wiser.</p><p name="b0c4" id="b0c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, this isn’t the main issue. The main issue arises after we’ve created so many of these different narratives to a point where we need to keep maintaining so many different perspectives to keep our mind sane.</p><p name="499d" id="499d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We create a dependency of narratives that eventually develop into obsessions which is why you have people who constantly self-criticise and things like anorexia develop etc.</p><p name="2d11" id="2d11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The beautiful thing about these narratives is that they’re seemingly harmless. Surely a thought can’t harm us?</p><p name="f5af" id="f5af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I say this first hand as someone who has become incredibly mentally ill as a result of the incessant narratives in our mind and I believe it is a crisis that we all develop at some point in our life.</p><p name="61f3" id="61f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Post-natal depression, mid-life crisis, it doesn’t matter how old you are or what level of experience you have, at some point in your life you are going to suffer from these narratives if you do not prepare your mind.</p><p name="d62e" id="d62e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So by writing these kinds of articles, you merely create alternative narratives in your mind, to combat other narratives, all which do not exist yet affect us in the real world.</p><p name="2e5c" id="2e5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The alternative instead is to dismantle these narratives.</p><p name="7920" id="7920" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Don’t linger on these pointless thoughts. Dissolve them. Recognise them as lies and continue on with your day.</p><p name="4de4" id="4de4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most people don’t do this because a) They’ve relied on these narratives their entire lives and b) They simply don’t know how.</p><p name="357f" id="357f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the issue is that it takes many years of studying self-awareness before you can even remotely hope to stop these thoughts.</p><p name="22a6" id="22a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The worst part is that because they are seemingly benign, people just allow them to reign free. In fact, they assume that these narratives are completely normal, so they just let it happen. It is a dangerous privilege to have.</p><p name="b66a" id="b66a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s only once you develop significant mental illness that you realise it’s not normal and you decided to change… which unfortunately, seems to be how it plays out in most people.</p><p name="6630" id="6630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps the worst aspect is that writers like you make a living off giving people more and more narratives to consider, until eventually we’re all having mental breakdowns and suffering under the lies we cannot control in our mind.</p><p name="bc52" id="bc52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, please don’t take my word for it. If this kind of introspection works for you, then by all means, do what feels natural for you. It would be rude of me to suggest otherwise :)</p><p name="2b59" id="2b59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I just have this slight inkling that humans aren’t as different as we may seem and that it is in fact, detrimental to all. Rather, learn to develop self-awareness skills early so a) You won’t need to read articles like this and b) You can future proof yourself from mental illness.</p></div></div></section>
