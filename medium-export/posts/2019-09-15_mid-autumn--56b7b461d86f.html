Bloodshot and merciless. He had mastered his purpose, and that’s really all there was to it.</p><p name="45bc" id="45bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like a trained algorithm of infallible precision, his pupils dotted from input to output, scanning the items one-by-one as if tautologically speaking — it was what his hands were designed to do.</p><p name="c0e1" id="c0e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, maybe it’s just a different world. Where modes are genetic. Where imagination is literal, and clouding your reality is a vision of survival that barely touches itself at all, as if to suggest self-introspection was a very dirty habit indeed.</p><p name="584a" id="584a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Diffused and crystallised into packets of untouched sincerity, the remaining scatters of light faltered itself into uneven rows, corrupting the inherent laws of asinine symmetry we’ve all come to know and love.</p><p name="403f" id="403f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet, the anxiety was real.</p><p name="27c4" id="27c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It permeated well-beyond his slick haircut and passionless criminal past, worn directly as an omen of forgiveness on his sleeve. The cake is out of time and the 1’s and 0’s surging through his brain have hopelessly collapsed itself into stacks upon stacks of pre-packaged Hitler Youth.</p><p name="7ed1" id="7ed1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He grabs my partner’s purse.
