Earlier I was thinking about the term “mental illness” and how it conveys within us, the ideals we hold for each other. </p><p name="439b" id="439b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It can be easy to fall into the trap of believing that mental illness is a moral argument, or something “bad” that should be inextricably avoided. It is a holy product of our society built upon more than two millennia of religion and judgement as a deciding factor behind our reasons and motives. On the other hand, it is an argument that merely creates guilt and stigma, rather than explain to any individual the quality for what it is.</p><p name="26ed" id="26ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this debate there are two components we must observe. There is the descriptor, which in our cases is “mental illness” and then there is the generalisation, which is “society”. The larger society becomes, the more general your description of mental illness must become, which religion aside, must eventually dissolve into a “this is bad and this is good”war of common stupidity. </p><p name="e904" id="e904" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, behaviours aren’t “bad”. They’re just behaviours. They have no ultimate consequence or desire for your manifest destiny. Whether you murder someone or give them a million dollars makes no difference to the ultimate equation. As far as nature is concerned, we’re merely a bunch of collective molecules fighting it out for a piece of rapidly growing, then shrinking pie. </p><p name="9adb" id="9adb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike nature on the other hand, society cannot be so… faithless in its own people, otherwise to fear (note: fear) disorder and disharmony. In society there is good and bad. Not because it is an efficient or even lenient way of organising people, but because that’s what ticks the boxes in a court of order. </p><p name="9663" id="9663" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So why is mental illness so bad then? Put simply, it contradicts the working function of greater society. Mental illness, more often than not, impedes upon desired progress. Young men and women, both smart, intelligent and capable, rather than contribute towards the cycle of pie, and instead wither away in their own rooms, bringing atrophy to a party of none. </p><p name="b054" id="b054" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you begin to think about mental illness as a product of a society, rather than something significant to consider, it becomes apparent how backwards society is. Working 70 hours a week to build a business in lieu of constant stress is considered admirable and ambitious, whilst dedicating your life towards fruitless pleasure is not. Smoking and coffee are desirable if they allow you to focus, no matter what damage they do to our health. </p><p name="480d" id="480d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Again, not that it matters. It’s just another way of describing the nature of the reality, rather than the societal definition. </p><p name="8841" id="8841" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Society is a moving function and mental illness in that case, is a disease. At the same time, that is not to suggest that mental illness isn’t bad or shouldn’t be desired. Perhaps there is a beautiful way of living outside of society that we have no yet discovered, yet what I do suggest is that this process is inherently harmful for all individuals trying to discover themselves in this large and lonely world. </p><p name="8dd2" id="8dd2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rather than isolate the behaviour and treat it if necessary, we instead ravage ourselves within the shame and insecurity, like our treating our burns with impetuous fire. We make people feel worse about themselves, rather than give them the confidence to challenge their own way of thinking. We do not enlighten, so much that we ensnare and entrap. </p><p name="ba18" id="ba18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Admittedly, I bit the bullet. </p><p name="3db6" id="3db6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not sure why I decided to co-operate with society, however in retrospect, I don’t think integration into society was the ultimate goal. Rather, I was more interested in understanding and studying the process with which to overcome my mental illness, of which integrating into society was the most stable and accepted. </p><p name="e5e1" id="e5e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Post-society. </p><p name="a285" id="a285" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now there’s something interesting for me to think about into the future. About what I want to do with my new-found mental state and my ability to becoming anything I want. I can be that sad stretch, lying like a dead sausage amongst an field of agony, or I can be like a phoenix, soaring to heights that eventually kill me, leaving what little I own to the atmosphere so willing to let me be free. </p><p name="4a43" id="4a43" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="58f2" id="58f2" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
