Throw em’ a pack em’ wet ones, sweetheart. Shine it n’ grime. Brain delegation, you pampered slut. Concoct like it’s your last pay check, ol’ slippery schmuck would say. Perfection brewed pain, crowded into a tiny house of plastic figurines to chow you down. First they sell em’ high, then they break em’ low. Cryin’ cause you like it. Homeless cause you know it.</p><p name="919e" id="919e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The diluted drainage tastes of false positives, faltering like candy medicine for the sick and dying. White bubbling acid makin’ rancid faces, cause it ain’t okay to chuckle rabid. Welcome to fallback hell, this elaborate ruse I’ve constructed for your brightest hour, featuring myself, the King of Fallbacks. You see, we design desperate fashion chic with a porous glee. Preventative flicker. Oh, clasp the sound we love. Red, white and particular. These stripes are wrapping around my arm, finding reason to tell mummy of my absence.</p><p name="626f" id="626f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The protruding orange hurts most, though the young ones sure do love it. Risk the fucking board game. Make the lines rain.</p><p name="47d5" id="47d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, I have an amazing life partner so why ruin it all? Aside from the crushing insecurity and beckoning desire to slip a cheeky one into a damp cloth, everyone knows monogamy is a survival mentality. Everyone needs a significant other to hold accountable. “Don’t set the milk on fire sweetie, my lawyers are watching with a tippity-toe.” Someone to tell you that you mean something, cause I’m dying for a family of my own, yeah?</p><p name="482f" id="482f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Actually, it’s even weirder when you get down to the nitty-gritty. I remember distinctly not wanting a girlfriend due to all of the pain and misery that my mother endured… and largely created. Terrible partners to less-than-stellar men. Drunks. Deadbeats. Talk about a renaissance.</p><p name="5da4" id="5da4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I’m a smart one. Gettin’ smarter every Tuesday, my doctor says. Following my genes down to the very last sperm, discarded in a shoebox full of condoms from previous partners. Dribbled residue resembling Christ on the crucifixion of oust, as if water had been turned into cum. Eventually, your desires get ahead of you and you realise that you’re feeble and molecular. “Yes, I desperately need a women, and I need her now. Otherwise, I’ll end up dying a prawn.” Certainly, don’t go full prawn. It looks bad on your resume.</p><p name="1bac" id="1bac" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…and at this precise moment, you become instantly vulnerable and all that horrible stuff you said you’d never let hurt you again, instantly takes hold and drills a dark message into your skull, wondering how things could have gotten so bad.”</p><p name="e405" id="e405" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the other hand, I also have career prospects. A lifepath to help me, unlike sucking down on a homemade bong from Bunnings which mind you, was very good. It’s like this pretty cage I’ve built for myself, to pretend as if these bars are actually friendly popsicles, to be consumed and devoured like a non-consentual act of grace.</p><p name="730c" id="730c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe that’s why I grew up so cynical. I would assume everyone who wasn’t me was living in some kind of dank prison; a prison that only I could possibly be aware of. “I mean, how stupid can these prison people be? Why not just be a 10 year old child instead, rather than gulp down the responsibility you all seem to collect and tally?” In part, I was right. Most people are in an unaware prison, garnered towards preferential treatment.</p><p name="fe30" id="fe30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though empathy for the prisoners, for I am your kind too.</p><p name="e022" id="e022" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, I make a better prisoner than most. I mean, you should SEE some of the mental constructs I’ve deconstructed over the years. Insanity. Mental ineptitude. Do I remember punching a woman in the face? You’re supposed to love me, you idiot.</p><p name="ff10" id="ff10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like most double-edged swords, focus is where it’s at. Focus on your dreams and make them your reality.</p><p name="86f6" id="86f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">w\rite till you die.</p></div></div></section>
