<section name="09e7" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="f52f" id="f52f" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading graf--title">reject.</h3><p name="6e20" id="6e20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In a lot of ways, rejection has been a core theme in my life, and in a lot of ways, it’s been an idea which I’ve peddled in various forms without the kind of grace you see on home-brand white-label items. Whether that be through self-hatred, crippling insecurity or eventual peace; no one can deny an emotionally pleasing  bargain.</p><p name="fa70" id="fa70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By all means I do not doubt that  it’s been a hard path, and in saying so, I would like to preface what I’m about to write with the clause that no one ever intentionally wants a hard, confusing path. Rather,  it’s a path which we can happen to find ourselves in, which we  try to make the best of without ending in the kind of misery that has me jumping in front of a train. </p><p name="be39" id="be39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, I would at least like to think that my actions are in some way breaking the cycle which has existed purely as  the scorn of my existence since my very conception, although with full skepticism I strongly suspect that my downfall may even be part of the plan. And that hidden within my rejection is in fact a shadow of generational destruction which my genetic cannot discern. </p><p name="82d4" id="82d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I mean, honestly. I’m just a kid trapped inside my own false pre-conceptions of good cop and bad cop. </p><p name="3889" id="3889" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, I reject my parents and family completely. I don’t keep in contact with them. I certainly have no desire to, in part because they don’t make me feel accepted within myself, and those with at least one Asian parent can probably relate. It’s an absolute nightmare.</p><p name="7b75" id="7b75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s probably a very selfish point of view, as I’m sure everyone is merely trying their best, but I can’t help how I think and feel. That’s just part of the package, as much as I’ve tried to mold and shape what little integrity I have left. I’m trying to do good in my life, and sometimes that means saying no and learning to cut through the guilt.</p><p name="7395" id="7395" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After all, the guilt doesn’t actually exist. You just have to reinterpret your surroundings, and in order to do this it can help to maintain a few hard-line principles which you believe are fair; not emotional, Stockholm bullshit. </p><p name="901b" id="901b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In line with my rejection of my family, for example, I maintain that family is a relationship built on love and  friendship, not per-conceived motions of expectation, respect and obligation. </p><p name="3e63" id="3e63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, my mother in no way, shape or form is my friend. We do not get along. The pleasantries are dull. </p><p name="2320" id="2320" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mother is </p><p name="e22d" id="e22d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the deal; I’ve come to realise a few certain truths or hardcore principles which I believe are fair. </p><p name="aa1d" id="aa1d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="1f19" id="1f19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I reject society. </p><p name="2211" id="2211" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In particular, feelings of rejection towards who I am and what I have to offer to society. </p><p name="2c10" id="2c10" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="5c5a" id="5c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most importantly, I reject myself. </p><p name="b086" id="b086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rejecting yourself is hard, and I’m still not quite sure what it means, nor even what self-acceptance is. I mean, I think I practice self-acceptance, but I’m sure I’m plainly deluded in what I actually know is going on in my mind. </p><p name="4ed1" id="4ed1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
