Of course, my attention, considering this post will never be published, however still to the attention of thus none-the-less. </p><p name="6b82" id="6b82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today has been difficult. Aside from waking up at 4am this morning, I am simply drained. I don’t think I particularly enjoy what I do, yet I believe that’s what it takes to build trust within a business relationship, because the fact is that any long term endeavours are going to have difficult spots, and the only way to prove that you are capable is by putting in the hard yards. </p><p name="8f84" id="8f84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The good news is that I’ve been at my job for nearly 10 months. That’s something, ey. </p><p name="fc15" id="fc15" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was feeling quite vulnerable today, at least in terms of my triggers. Certainly, the one thing that really triggers me is being sleep deprived, so my mind has been fluctuating, however I’ve also been quite good. I didn’t let my destructive urges destroy me. I didn’t wallow. Sure, I was a bit vulnerable, however I’ve come to accept that I still owe it the responsibility not to carry out on my destructive tendencies and to still be a good citizen.</p><p name="a3b2" id="a3b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a lot of things that I have come to accept within myself, as well as a lot of things that I’m still trying to figure out. For the most part, I feel accustomed with the path I have chose. </p><p name="5a57" id="5a57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That really is what it feels like a lot of the time. It feels like a kind of unverifiable path, which I have chosen, which I have trained myself to become comfortable with. Maybe it was the easy way out. Maybe it’s easier to just commit to a path and really learn and understand that path, rather than just be a random soul, without premonition as to where it is going.</p><p name="0330" id="0330" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps hubris is how I would describe the latter. </p><p name="2997" id="2997" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, I’m getting a lot better with simply accepting the things that I’m traditionally uncomfortable with. While seeing sexy internet ads still affect me, it doesn’t render me useless. I acknowledge that it’s difficult, yet no more difficult than I make it out to be. </p><p name="323d" id="323d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe the issue is that I don’t get enough time to be a dipshit. You know, to just fuck around and, you know, be a kid. The options are endless, perhaps tireless. Is it passion? Is it obsession!? Is there such thing as balance, for those engineers as myself who wish nothing but to create? Perhaps there is no end to the madness. Perhaps I am the madness, and more. </p><p name="eee4" id="eee4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am living. I am breathing. I have overcome a lot in my life, however it is certainly no better, nor any worse, than what I could potentially have today. CRUD. </p><p name="bd09" id="bd09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the very least I would like to think that I’m a lot wiser than I was in the past. Yes. Much wiser, much wittier, whatever. </p><p name="d2f0" id="d2f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’m currently researching about the C programming language. How quaint.</p></div></div></section>
