There are only two pictures of my father that I remember ever seeing. One picture was blue-tacked onto the wall of the attic in my old Kallista house. In this picture, my father is a young boy on the couch, gleefully sitting with his brothers and sisters. The other picture contains what looks like my father with another female, who may have been a girlfriend at the time before meeting my mother. In my mind, the girlfriend sort of looks like a young Sarah Silverman. </p><p name="0cfb" id="0cfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I had to describe my father, I would probably say he reminds me of the main protagonist in the film The Wog Boy; constantly smoking and drinking like any working-class figure would do. I remember he used to drive a white van (apparently my mother paid for it), complemented by a Cartlon longneck shoved between his thighs, which would immediately be hidden away between his feet at the sign of any police activity.</p><p name="9015" id="9015" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose the sad thing is that I don’t feel anything for him. I don’t know who he is, what his dreams and hopes are, what makes him happy or sad. I literally don’t think about him at all. I have no connection with him, no desire to what to know him.</p><p name="9c89" id="9c89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet part of me still felt compelled to write this. </p><p name="2c1a" id="2c1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I was sixteen years old he decided to call me. I was sitting at the computer at the time, playing what was probably Team Fortress 2. At first I did not recognise who it was. The voice was completely foreign to me, and even once he did tell me he was my father, I </p><p name="5320" id="5320" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mother had painted me for the archibald and </p><p name="c52b" id="c52b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="7e3b" id="7e3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The only two pictures I remember of him  </p></div></div></section>
