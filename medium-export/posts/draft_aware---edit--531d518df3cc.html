These words you read, as beautiful as they may, have usually been crafted as part of an elaborate work of art, rather than as a sentient notion of threat and eradication. While some of the manic is real, a large portion of it merely exists as a prefabricated intellectual cirlcle-jerk cuddling my mind, as I love to write, and the writing loves me. </p><p name="13d8" id="13d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d recently had a huge argument with my housemate. Ugly, drunken shouting. Aside from the instant polarity of our personalities, ranging from the excessive extroverted to the saddened introvert inside me, we unleashed a kind of inexplicable rage of opinion. Anyway, I’ll keep the details fine as I hope not to step on the hands and feet of the innocent.</p><p name="83de" id="83de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’ve all been going through a very tough time. I’m unemployed. He’s got family issues. Not to mention my girlfriend, and her equally contrived feelings and emotions. Then it all broke down and I was left hugging the floor, as the tirade of madness swept us from our positions and drowned us in a dark and unforgiving haze. </p><p name="f5b9" id="f5b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have my doubts whether we actually managed to achieve anything, however certainly, I have become more aware of myself. Precisely, all the horrible things I have done and said. I don’t see it as a bad thing. It’s important that the truth comes out, however now that I am aware, I feel so keenly ambivalent and self-conscious of all the hurt and pain I have caused, completely unknown to myself. </p><p name="0f72" id="0f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Put simply, I feel ashamed and disgusted with who I am. I feel inhuman to the people who are closest to my life and I feel irrelevant even to my own life. I’m struggling with who I am internally, tossing and turning in a rotting salad of bad. My issue is that I say things that really hurt people and I don’t realise I say these hurtful things. You see, people don’t tell you. They hide their feelings and their pain. Then it’s only when it gets to a point where they can’t take it anymore, that they </p><p name="b1ae" id="b1ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of it has to do with my depression and particularly my unemployment, but also a large part of it has to do with my sense of humour. You know when you watch those comedy roasts where they just say the most horrible things that make you laugh so hard your eyes burst out of your skull? I’m that guy. I say terrible things, but really witty </p><p name="bda3" id="bda3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a while, it gets to a point where you’ll say absolutely anything.</p><p name="9d82" id="9d82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not entirely sure how it gets to this point, however I think a large part of it comes down to becoming too comfortable with others. You therefore think it’s okay to kick them while they’re down, in their most vulnerable places, thinking that they couldn’t possibly take it personally because you’re their best and closest friend. </p><p name="365b" id="365b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Guilt and shame, shaken and stirred. </p><p name="7b42" id="7b42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel so acutely aware of myself that it’s beginning to peel me from the inside. Almost everything is reminder of my own inability to empathise and agree and it hurts to think that I’ve been this way for years, without knowing. What hurts most is to think that no one has the courage to tell me, which is understandable when I come to think about it. </p><p name="739d" id="739d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
