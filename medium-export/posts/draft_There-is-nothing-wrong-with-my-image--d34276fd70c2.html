I don’t know what it is about capturing my own physical self on film, only the amount of attrition felt within the process is clearly unhealthy. </p><p name="ef79" id="ef79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I immediately become self-conscious about what I look like. My hair is a fuzzy, incomprehensible mess. My facial hair can’t quite decide how much it wants to shame me and I’m still wearing the same clothes my mother decided was appropiate upon embarking puberty. </p><p name="8afe" id="8afe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My face looks terrible from all angles, no matter how hard I try. Most importantly, I just don’t care. It doesn’t bother me what I look like, precisely why I don’t usually take pictures of myself. </p><p name="35de" id="35de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of it comes down to the way in which we self-identify with myself. Each time I look at myself in a mirror, I do not see myself. The idea of who I am does not reside in what I look like.</p><p name="11f6" id="11f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead I tend to identify with the ideas, the thoughts, the feelings and emotions that run through my blood. Oh, what a wonderful realm for self-delusion to aspire to. Trust me, it ain’t pretty. </p><p name="3115" id="3115" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s something surreal, something immaculately exciting about the world of words and logic that I find entirely inseperable from who I am. I could live entirely without music or sex or drugs, but in it’s stead is the strong connection I maintain with the intellectual beauty of my thoughts. </p><p name="b14d" id="b14d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe part of the problem is that as a species so entwined with technology, with cartoons and with ideas, we have been conditioned not to identify ourselves as human. </p><p name="4c86" id="4c86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humanity is a lost cause in a world full of pornography, ideology and politics.</p><p name="a328" id="a328" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our aspirations are no longer as simple as consuming pre-definable roles. The complexity in our minds laugh uncontrollably at the mential tasks we are borne to carry out on a daily basis. </p><p name="1bee" id="1bee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our minds can’t  handle it the triviality of existence. It crumbles into boredom. We want to be Hollywood celebrities, imaginary sex gods, other kin; highly exaggerated constructions which could not possibly exist in our human bodies. </p><p name="fbef" id="fbef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Mental illness. You’ve done it again. </p></div></div></section>
