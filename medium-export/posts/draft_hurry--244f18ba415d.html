Harry has now become this sidewalk’s newest feature, keen with several building-code violations and a knack for pedestrian obscurity. Static and incomprehensible, his body now represents a somewhat innate expression of protest known only to forensic pathologists and buddhist monks.</p><p name="3dcd" id="3dcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because although silence is not a game, it may as well the hot millennial ticket this summer, so grab yourself a seat while you can.</p><p name="e414" id="e414" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“And a subtle reminder folks that this week’s prominent  highball has been sponsored by Tom and Sally, and I promise the glass was without worry when it smashed itself into the gutter.”</p><p name="2c75" id="2c75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, and how blood loves to seep into the nooks and crannies of evidence highway, a   concrete sludge of mismatch-memory holding your brittle ego together, because you couldn’t quite decide how best to un-amalgamate your childish drunken fiasco, as it  stares you down like a dumb aristocrat with a cauliflower for a brain. </p><p name="bdf9" id="bdf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your sixes are now turning into fours. </p><p name="1a37" id="1a37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know if you know, but when I hold a chainsaw I look like a real man. I have status. I have grandeur on proportions which go beyond the salty wounds you yourself pretend, and yet you still don’t quite know what to do because ur a fuckin’ idiot. </p><p name="55cb" id="55cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even though the homework is right in-front of you, some part of that mustard tarnish of a sulfide which programs your mind is telling you otherwise. The numbers aren’t aligning and holy shit, your  neighbors are now staring at you and I believe the nervous one has already called the police. </p><p name="77ee" id="77ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How rude.</p><p name="bfbb" id="bfbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that’s okay, because you’re king. I mean, you have a gun and that’s pretty awesome. Which is why you’re going to load in another round, gently caress the barrel and please the peasantry with some debonair fireworks. </p><p name="9f64" id="9f64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First you kill Harry, cause that fucker is real annoying — and then you kill Sam. Obviously oo one likes Sam, which is totally why you’re killing him. It would be unreasonable to not kill Sam, because with Harry now out of the picture; fuck it. Sam goes too. </p><p name="c2e8" id="c2e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At that point, you’ve basically done as much as you can, because assuming you even make it this far you’ll probably want dinner and you’re not the type to rush the happy conveniences of cuckhold </p><p name="2bf8" id="2bf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">and that’s no state for any man to be in. Drugs and sex. That’s what you know and that’s why you’re diversifying into the murder scene. You can always fuck a man in jail, but kill a man with a neck tat? I don’t thing so. </p><p name="7ec2" id="7ec2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At some point you’ll probably realise that you don’t even know these people, and that’s cool too. Maybe it’s just an insecurity of yours; that thing which begs acceptance even though </p><p name="0340" id="0340" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="4ea6" id="4ea6" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
