I can feel the love flowing through me. I have been bubbly, cheerful and full of life! I’m not quite sure what happened, however it’s like a switch flicked on inside me. </p><p name="14ca" id="14ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the kind of love that makes me realise how amazing my girlfriend is. I love her so much, more than the entire world (seriously), and it’s scary to think that I cannot see that sometimes. It’s weird how I go from feeling absolutely nothing, to feeling nothing but love. </p><p name="9f2d" id="9f2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So now to the mix-match part.</p><p name="ce9d" id="ce9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This morning was a bit of a terror. Not waking up, but at work. Mum tried to contact me at work, calling the work office three times and it was a bit disturbing for me. After the first call, the manager asked me what it was about and I broke down in front of her, explain how I’d cut off contact with my mother. She was so incredibly understanding about the whole thing and it made me appreciate her so much. </p><p name="27a5" id="27a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wasn’t in the best mood at work. I was a little startled by my mother, however I managed to practice my drawing throughout all my lunch breaks and lunch. Earlier in the day, Swathy, the conference producer, mentioned she wanted to speak to me in a meeting about my “workload” and it got me crazy worried, as if she knew I did no work today. Thankfully it turned out to be about her taking leave, so that was good. </p><p name="dbe3" id="dbe3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was very busy at work today. I didn’t really bother with reading online articles. I went straight to writing the news/Expotrade press releases for VIC Major and managed to complete that within a few hours. Then I wrote six news articles, as well as started WA 5th release. Though I didn’t feel exhausted. I managed to power through it and I guess it felt… I don’t know. Good. </p><p name="8f9f" id="8f9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though I realised something very important about my mother. I realised the reason why I decided to cut her off, was because she could not accept me as an individual, and subsequently, I could not be with her until she would accept the fact that I’m not in her life. Ironically, if she did accept it, then that would mean I wouldn’t need to be in her life, so there. But understanding this made me realise my relationship with mimi and respect the fact that she deserves her space and privacy. </p><p name="cb6f" id="cb6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For whatever reason, I was just in an amazing mood when I got home. I ate dinner with Jess, then I practiced my drawing, and I just felt as if today was incredibly well balanced. Maybe that’s what I was struggling with, moving out. I was struggling to find balance in my life. Gladly, I stuck at it, stuck to my principles and here I am, feeling positive about myself and the world. </p><p name="babf" id="babf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also noticed today, that my drawing improved dramatically today. It’s like, I just have the confidence to draw. I have a great deal of proficiency drawing basic shapes. However, just like anything else in life, it’s a matter of practice and perhaps like anything else in life, I simply enjoy learning and finding utility in the basic things. </p><p name="f220" id="f220" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reminds me of when I decided to learn shorthand. I got quite good, however eventually I reached a point where I could not find the utility in the skill. Sometimes skills cannot just exist on their own. </p><p name="483b" id="483b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Likewise, coding can help me making money. Art can help me better understand construction. Writing, as ever, is a talent I feel like I have already explored to death and is something which I believe compliments, rather than truly can stand on it’s own. Of course, not true. William S. Burroughs, you brilliant man. </p><p name="60b7" id="60b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Great day. Looking forward to tomorrow :)</p></div></div></section>
