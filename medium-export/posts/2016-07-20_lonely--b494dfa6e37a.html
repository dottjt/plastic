It dun love you, cause it ain’t care. It only ever prods and provokes, deliberating an ever-greater hole for you to sink your loneliness into, smothering all completeness into an astronomical mass of NOTHING. Please smile, you idiot.</p><p name="80ad" id="80ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Misconstruing your desires into a visceral totality, the conspiracy fractures to which all is known. Aaaaaand you can literally hear the WANK, oh how delicious!</p><p name="76c1" id="76c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…yet somewhere in this universe, as lonely as it may be, exists a young alien as it gapes into our nebula and devours the dack emotional unhappiness causing calamity in a rush of human misfortune, avidly tickling away at the depravity your excitement intended. The locals have come to ponder, for the spectrum is wild at play.</p><p name="839c" id="839c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, it’s just another lucky day for our veins as they collaborate in liquid tones, pouring themselves like dirty bath water all over the sick and dying nature professed. “Bring me my bottle and I shall bring you your home. If you must know, it’s a vat of unregulated acid in the burbs’ though it sure do look pretty in that bright sunlight they got going on.”</p><p name="0dbf" id="0dbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My face feels like a heroin overdose, causing it to cease all human construction and collapse into my neck, producing a brittle economy of fatal impotence. The apathy is crass and tired, delegating what little secrets to my gouging typing nuns. The uninitiated boredom, though real, is attempting to envision an outside reality full of danger and irrational aggression. I mean, it’s incredible I haven’t already thrown my broken head into the television set over there, shattering my precious electronic possessions with a series of angry contortions and symbolic classicism.</p><p name="77e6" id="77e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In America we shoot guns but in good ol’ Australia we pretend to upload a five-star quality of life, pittering and pattering at the delusions of human integrity we all unconvincingly sign up for at birth. Is that truly my pulse beating in my lungs, or is it just another medical drip to keep my heart from outpacing a steady 80 BEATS per fucking MINUTE!?</p><p name="96d9" id="96d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the corner of my eye is a beautiful pixie, strutting around the corridors and begging me to splurge. She loosely drapes her innocence to the side of her shoulder, allowing me to see where daddy hit her. I think it’s turning me on, though my girlfriend is beginning to become suspicious of the unknown pair of panties in her draw: freshly washed and ironed, as the pixie demanded.</p><p name="c3b0" id="c3b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though in the time it’s taken to return back to reality, the pixie has walked off with my money and my heart has sold itself to a morally bankrupt institution, because apparently a bad attitude isn’t the same as owning assets. Only in the VR world can you have your porn and eat it too.</p><p name="cc8f" id="cc8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe the issue is that I’m not spending enough of my hard-earned cash to live the capitalist dream. You know, a reality full of bath bombs and poorly drawn hentai lining the cup of my $5.30 coffee, hand brewed by a bastard in a sailor’s cap. Here, I’ll just drive my fantastic car with its four even wheels and you be you, as has always been the case when we meet up for our habitual two minutes of conversation, followed by a further seven minutes of shaming.</p><p name="d8f3" id="d8f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The lack of the human contact leeches you and rips into your soul, repossessing everything you’ve always wanted, selling it to the attention of those who barely care.</p><p name="9966" id="9966" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a racket. It’s a damn racket, shrouded in silence.</p><p name="a8ff" id="a8ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The commissary begins.</p></div></div></section>
