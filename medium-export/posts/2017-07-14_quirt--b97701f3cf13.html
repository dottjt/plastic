Kneading and twisting her ankle into a incalculable dough, the ligament snaps, crushing bone at multiple points along the way.</p><p name="6067" id="6067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pulverising jelly into a cheap though largely familiar commodity, her luscious exterior crumples to the floor. Oh, and that delicious soup of reprise, sopping wildly from her face?</p><p name="6721" id="6721" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hungry has thy hungry done.</p><p name="16e6" id="16e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A thicket of blood splatters against my forehead, femur splintering against an array of unidentifiable seafood and horrific gore — served freely as the Romans would have demanded. Clarissa, without the sheen.</p><p name="4907" id="4907" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The feint tremble in her hands, suitably matched against the cordoned sully of her overt silence, flows outwards upon the multiple scars now blurring her youthless vision.</p><p name="006f" id="006f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Exposed to the miserable temperature of the concrete floor below, a fascinating world of bacteria conglomerates within the sweat and clamour dribbling seepage like raw seaweed from her iris; the image of her desire now reduced to that of a bargain-bin cookbook.</p><p name="6769" id="6769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her tight-fitting bra only made it worse.</p><p name="68e8" id="68e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Porous amnesia wiping crutt all over the in-consumate of her mouth; the men gather and consume.</p><p name="8c0f" id="8c0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her once palatable face, clobbered against the farewell of an uncanny object, laid drooping against a backdrop of substitute and human regret. Dallied in hours of screams and yearning, a subtle hint was approaching that I couldn’t quite remise. FUck you.</p><p name="e99f" id="e99f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As if I were somehow responsible.</p><p name="cf16" id="cf16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now admittedly, the crowd wasn’t pleased. They paid good money to watch us mingle through the online lens of a $49.95 virtual playpen, but now that our romance was dead, her innocence exposed to the excess of drink — well, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">no one</em> wants to see that. Quaint drama proliferating itself into a bathhouse of post after-party champagne. Quite frankly, it’s rude.</p><p name="2a1a" id="2a1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet as she laid there on the floor, decorated in painful glass, moping in a spontaneous fit of alcoholic breath and illiterate promotion, it was clear she wanted nothing more than for my hands to caress and mask the shame she had so beautifully conveyed.</p><p name="e068" id="e068" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her pain was intolerable, but so was not being paid.</p><p name="452d" id="452d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She grabbed herself by the hair and shoved herself onto me. Crass in the delirious smile she wore, I was merely to play the part of the anaesthetist, placing young Clarissa into a kind of emotional coma so she could pretend the coast was clear.</p><p name="7577" id="7577" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clear of the sorrow preventing her hollow.</p><p name="b6e5" id="b6e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Clumsily waiting by my doorstep, you could almost catch glimpse of the precious lace draping her shoulder, leaving your imagination with nothing more than the perverse possibility that maybe your brain was right.</p><p name="2a7d" id="2a7d" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Have more, you really should have more, you utterly silly thing”.</p><p name="131c" id="131c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Her body was magnificent, and yet tricky to handle. Of course, no doubt paid with your credit card.</p><p name="0521" id="0521" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And my gosh, all those meetings and long-hours must have been tough, what with the commercial apathy you laboured without even a hint of forward premonition. I’m sure your loyers will figure it owt.</p><p name="2d5e" id="2d5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, wait a second.</p><p name="d5a9" id="d5a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These are awful things to say about your lovely lady, and you know what? I am so fucking sorry that you had to bare witness to this mess; the mess I caused and created, the mess which fucked up your marriage, this mess which is eating away at you on the inside, and has now left you a broken wasteland of inconsiderable misfortune.</p><p name="a765" id="a765" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh, and those divorce papers should be arriving shortly, so I’d keep a look out, you know?</p><p name="f628" id="f628" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That bright shining star, that crescent moon — iridescent in the shadow you cast like a deranged rapist parading itself as the next president nominee. The pitter and tease that goes into producing the wonderful play of commitment and compromise, now lost to the irrelevance you seem to collect.</p><p name="f0a9" id="f0a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am the man sleeping with your wife.</p><p name="10d7" id="10d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fucking her. Touching her. Leaving her. Telling her the things she wishes to hear. Oh yes, and my gosh, these fingers are quite good. That sour taste of slippery ocean, crashing and clouding your rationale. How it tricks and convinces with a cunning eye; you are the strings you cannot seem to bare.</p><p name="1f47" id="1f47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And yet in my eyes, she is only an asset. Another play-thing for my grubby ambitions to squander, and twist, and turn, and tantalise, until the blood runs dry from the world, and transpires into a classical monument of pre-soviet propaganda.</p><p name="f275" id="f275" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll assure she keeps the children.</p><p name="b4e8" id="b4e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yours truly,</p><p name="38f3" id="38f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Julius Reade</p></div></div></section>
