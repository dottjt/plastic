See how hard it is just to embrace myself as a man, without having to passively apologise for who I am as an individual? There’s this great shame I almost carry as a man, simply because it is what I’m told on a daily basis through the media. </p><p name="b6f5" id="b6f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue is rather simple, in my eyes. I don’t believe there is anything wrong with men. Men are beautiful creatures, destined to create and strive and do amazing things in the world. </p><p name="543b" id="543b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The issue is in the things that we’re told we should not be and this pessimism which has dire consequences in the development of who we are as men. </p><p name="9fd1" id="9fd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Men are told not to rape women. Men are told not to assault women. Men are told not to be assholes. Men  are told so many things that were never qualities of man, yet have been branded as an integral part of who we are. </p><p name="f20b" id="f20b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the contrary, men are never told how to be good men. Instead, we’re given a list of requirements that have made us afraid to express even the most tattered state of innocence holding us together inside.</p><p name="ae55" id="ae55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a result, men have become insecure. We loath ourselves over internet pornography and video games, cause who even gives a shit any more. Apparently lounging around as a complete waste on the couch can’t draw any criticism. </p><p name="d465" id="d465" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though the issue is much deeper. </p><p name="2a71" id="2a71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe what is happening in society is that the very idea of man itself is becoming obscured. There seems to be a hatred of tradition from both sides of the camp. Women are sick of being portrayed as weak, and men are sick of having to give a shit. </p><p name="d075" id="d075" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These aspects are fair enough, however the problem is that human is inherently a creature of a tradition, rather than rational thought and the moment you remove tradition, you end up with chaos. </p><p name="bec0" id="bec0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You end up with men who become addicted to porn, men who stop even wanting be in a relationship. You end up with women who  begin to despise men for being </p><p name="d07c" id="d07c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the intellectualisation of society which we are seeing more and more each day. </p><p name="38b5" id="38b5" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="f52f" id="f52f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Individuality in men has completely dissolved into something incomprehensible and now there is nothing. </p><p name="30eb" id="30eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, it has been replaced by stupid memes perpetrated by stereotypes. Men like cars. Men like    and given the general stupidity of the human race, men around the world are buying it left, right and centre. </p><p name="3b79" id="3b79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And you know the funny thing? The same shit is happening to women as a result. </p><p name="c049" id="c049" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Women are dumb. Women are incapable. Women like make up and not only is it frustrating men because it’s happening, however it’s frustrating the hell out of women as well. </p><p name="dbf3" id="dbf3" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="a1f1" id="a1f1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
