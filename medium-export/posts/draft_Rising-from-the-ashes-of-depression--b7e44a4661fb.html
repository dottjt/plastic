It took me down to a dark and haunting place, transpired by misery; wreaking havoc on the parts of my mind I thought I had once resolved. </p><p name="8928" id="8928" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the cowering spiral of anxiety, guilt and fear, I haphazardly relinquished my control to the  addictions and self-absorbed retributions of the past, embracing a kind of compulsive self-hatred that I hadn’t experienced in years. </p><p name="afb2" id="afb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Personally speaking, I don’t believe that depression is something that you overcome indefinitely. While you may potentially be free of depression for weeks, months, years, even an entire life time — all it takes is a bad series of triggers before you find yourself cradling at the knees. </p><p name="c762" id="c762" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my case, my ex had re-activated her Facebook account, relations with my mother had completely deteriorated and my girlfriend’s abusive parents were placing immense pressure on our  relationship.</p><p name="fa53" id="fa53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was on-top of the fact that I was only just getting back into YouTube, (another major cause of mental illness in the past), as well as with the stress of trying to sort my freelance writing career … all during that one time of year where things are supposed to be smooth and rosy: Christmas. </p><p name="92ec" id="92ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You know, I was actually doing incredibly well for myself up until that point. Most of my mental health issues were sorted for months. Sure, I’d have the occasional slip up, however it was nothing devastating. I had forgone masturbation for the longest time than I’d ever had before (pornography is a huge source of addiction for me) and I was incredibly focused and motivated on learning and pursuing my career aspirations.</p><p name="b108" id="b108" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then one by one, the bricks began to fall. </p><p name="305e" id="305e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gradually the stress built up in the back of mind, becoming more and more prominent. I felt demotivated from learning; from the things that I usually felt passionate about, like coding. </p><p name="2f50" id="2f50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I thought that this war normal, because it was the holiday period and I was without routine. So I started to make lists of what I should do each day, which made things worse. I just felt even more stressed about having to do so much, when I didn’t feel like doing it. The expectation killed me.</p><p name="195b" id="195b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I soon began to develop urges. I felt like masturbating to porn for the first time in nearly half a year and the whole thing collapsed from underneath me. </p><p name="a1ad" id="a1ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mind crumbled and I began resuming all the horrible habits and mental processes which made me want to rip my skin apart. In my state of depression, my thoughts bombard me and surround me. I feel entirely victimised for my being and living becomes unbearable. </p><p name="bd10" id="bd10" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="be62" id="be62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One other aspect I find very interesting is that whenever I have a breakdown, I usually always arrive to the exact same conclusion/epiphany as I always do and yet somewhere along the line, in the daze of happiness in-between depression, it all fades away into the abyss.</p><p name="8d52" id="8d52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It has made me realise one very important thing: </p><blockquote name="dfed" id="dfed" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">You and your brain are not the issue. Your mental illness is due to the toxic people and events in your life. </blockquote><p name="e4b3" id="e4b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The fact that you experience times of mental illness, is likely because you are surrounded by toxic people, which means that you will likely encounter these types of people into the future.</p><p name="ee8f" id="ee8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, this almost explains why self-awareness is bullshit. Kind of. </p><p name="5d55" id="5d55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Self-awareness an amazing tool to have when things are not going smoothly and you need perspective to pick yourself up. In fact, without self-awareness in these hard times you may very well remain the conceptually jelly that you are.</p><p name="d3d8" id="d3d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However if you’re living a happy, motivating life, then you don’t need to worry about how you think. In fact, you have no worry at all. Life is beautiful and you can even overcome modert events. It all just comes naturally. </p><p name="75e2" id="75e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, not everyone is happy or motivated, which may be your issue. In my case however, I feel as if I have so much life to give, yet  at bogged down by the people and circumstances around me. </p><p name="158a" id="158a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s the thing </p><p name="7ec8" id="7ec8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the beginning it was stress. </p><p name="89a1" id="89a1" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="d02c" id="d02c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="54e5" id="54e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"> so that you can have better insight into how you may personally deal with your own issues.</p><p name="dde2" id="dde2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before I continue writing, I would like to say that </p><p name="83b0" id="83b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">to take you through, so that you can have better insight into how you may personally deal with it. </p><p name="5fef" id="5fef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The interesting thing is that this episode was no different to previous ones, in that I usually come to the exact same realisations as I always have. It’s just when you experience a lot of bad things at once, it can trigger you to go down that dark path. </p><p name="f379" id="f379" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
