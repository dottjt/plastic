Where the world around me feels like this hollow identification I’ve been brought in to examine. </p><p name="0c49" id="0c49" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“…and to the right of me is a plant of some description, which is strikingly green to the point of intrepidation.”</p><p name="615b" id="615b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To be quite honest with you, I find life rather dull. You see, in life you’re either terrified or dull. You’re either living on the edge, with a packet of cigarettes in your left shoulder pocket, ready to punch the living shit out the next bordeau creature you see walk past, or you’re staying at home with a knife on the bench-top counter, keenly awaiting that critical moment  where  stabbing your eyes out becomes the only counter-measure towards addressing boredom.</p><p name="b404" id="b404" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humans dream of excess. We dream of chain smoking an entire pouch of lavender clippings, falling into a daze of Carbon Monoxide poisoning, only for most of us feel held back by reality — as if our dreams are somewhat of a burden on the co-exisence of both our happiness and our future. </p><p name="0e05" id="0e05" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Naturally, there are a few things we should all steer away from if we hope to maintain any amount of sanity. God is one of them. Heroin, likewise. </p><p name="f1ef" id="f1ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Constraints. Almost everything is a constraint in the physical world, yet when our minds are latching onto the digital orgasm of how best to splurge amongst the billions of pixels vying for our attention, ranging from the aesthetic to the obtuse, we collapse into a puddle of electric wrinkle and indecision.</p><p name="35cf" id="35cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve always wondered if I have bipolar disorder or if life is nothing more than the prestiguous fuck-boy, a ritual anti-exercise in how best to approach the bell-curve which has you choking by the neck. </p><p name="0368" id="0368" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Balance has always been something I’ve aspired to achieve. It’s what allows me to thrive, to have my cake and eat it twice. The reason I chase it is quite benign, and somewhat nihilistic. </p><p name="5a88" id="5a88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Put simply, what difference does it honestly make? What fucking difference does it make, whether I help that small child or slaughter him at the curb with a heavy fist and a deliberate marker? </p><p name="cbca" id="cbca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It doesn’t. It makes no difference at all, yet it highlights something much more empowering. It’s to say that all choices are valid, and this essentially does is normal the inherently ‘difficult’ and ‘tricky’ decisions most of us find troublesome.</p><p name="b55b" id="b55b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You want your balance? </p><p name="d4d3" id="d4d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No fuckin’ worries mate, because I can have it all. </p><p name="d044" id="d044" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I suppose that’s the one thing I don’t like about these narratives.
