I feel unable to recognise myself and who I am, though at the same time, I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing. After all, all this self-awareness/observation stuff is designed to slowly dissolve the ego and maybe I’m a little terrified at losing it all.</p><p name="8371" id="8371" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the one hand, I feel like myself by principle. I’m consistently motivated, ambitious and self-determined, as well as focused without distraction. It’s everything I hoped I would become. I feel like I’m in complete control of my life and my circumstances. In many ways, you could say that I’m a much more functional version of myself.</p><p name="732b" id="732b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hesitate to say ‘better’, because it’s important that I maintain neutrality in my thoughts, however I guess it’s something I’m not used to. There is something dystopian in this outcome and while I certainly feel a lot better about myself, I also feel a lot less than I used to. Instead of feeling the intense sadness and happiness in my life, I sort of live in a critical middle-bound.</p><p name="1f6c" id="1f6c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s also something about that sadness I enjoy. I’m not sure why, but nothing will compare to listening to music while sad. In fact, it’s what gives music meaning to me.</p><p name="4817" id="4817" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another issue is that I feel trapped by the predictability. My mind feels like it’s stuck within a psychological prison, protected by the guard of self-awareness prevents you from acting against yourself.</p><p name="d554" id="d554" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I’m just going crazy. I’m probably just going crazy.</p><p name="81f2" id="81f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, self-awareness does not allow you to develop these kinds of narratives, as they is not real, which is why I’m just going to close my eyes and relax my mind, and allow these interesting thoughts to disappear away into the subtle calmness.</p><p name="07da" id="07da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hard thing for me is adjusting to other people. I feel like my ever-stable mood is affecting my relationship. While I’m happy to be with my girlfriend and I love her dearly, I feel like I’m no longer the fun, explosive person I once was. I no longer laugh or derive enjoyment from other people’s judgements.</p><p name="169e" id="169e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel distant from them, even though I feel closer to myself. I don’t even feel like having sex anymore. I’ve become so good at focusing and blocking things out, that I don’t get any satisfaction from straying away from my goals and agendas.</p><p name="1fa8" id="1fa8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I think about, life makes it difficult to live out of principle, largely because very few people do it. Of course, self-awareness makes it incredibly easy to live out of principle</p><p name="d39f" id="d39f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe this is the compromise of having mental health in a profoundly sick society. Maybe I’m not quite at a point where I fully love myself and can direct my love to other people. On a deeper level, I also suspect that love and calmness is not what people want. I feel people are who are mentally unhealthy, crave sadness, guilt and jealousy and that is something I can no longer provide.</p><p name="4ea8" id="4ea8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the interesting things about self-awareness is that it isn’t about forcing self-control or discipline. Those things don’t work. The beauty of self-awareness is that it doesn’t force anything. It sort of… well, I would say it’s impossible to describe without doing it. It’s not anarchy, however I’d say it’s almost the inverse to self-control. Being self-aware is like</p><p name="9461" id="9461" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would describe self-awareness as a kind of intention, where you direct your intention without resistance or difficulty.</p><p name="88e8" id="88e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In a sense, it’s irresistible and fool proof. Like anything however, it’s a practice that takes time and effort. In the same sense, you can say that exercise is foolproof, if you can do it. Self-awareness is self-reinforcing in that it always leads to itself no matter what and recursively, you become calming and more in control of yourself.</p><p name="7550" id="7550" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we all know in the end, it’s only once you do lose your consciousness and your ability to control who you are, that you realise how precious autonomy is and how much it enables you to live a fulfilling life. In essence, I’m battling a long history of dysfunction, which my mind has been predisposed to since birth. I feel self-conscious to have the knowledge to control myself, as if I’m some kind of freak for having figured it out.</p><p name="33a1" id="33a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel like</p><p name="a3d8" id="a3d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">s-co�Cp�ׂ��{�l�=</p><p name="951f" id="951f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
