(edit) </h3><p name="4b1f" id="4b1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was thinking about all the people who were once a part of my life and it made me realise how much of a reject I am. At some point or another, my mind has consciously decided to repulse and contort at the many norms and traditions many of us take for granted. </p><p name="390a" id="390a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I no longer maintain contact with anyone in my family, including my own mother. Dad left early (thank god, I’m sure for both his and my own sake) and while I can only think of a handful of individuals who were nice not to gorge off the excessive charisma dreading from my soul, the rest were as meticulous and psychopathic as it comes. </p><p name="7601" id="7601" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Largely however, I will do anything to avoid my mother who I despise more than the fresh blood drooling from the mouths of innocent slaves, whipped like a dead horse in a field full of shit. </p><p name="1827" id="1827" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By any means it would not be fair to blame her and certainly, we are all victims within our own right. My leg for your trigger happy motives. Trade my limbs away. I think part of the motivation for leaving was to desecrate those aspects of my gene pool I didn’t want exposed to purity of clean air. There is no possible way I could allow my children to experience the detriment that I did growing up, and I’ll do anything to stop it. </p><p name="4626" id="4626" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see, there was this assumption that I would stay. </p><p name="eb7c" id="eb7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Silly assumption, I know, that no matter how badly or how unfairly I was battered, that I would simply accept the trauma and enforced through cultural servitude, gulp down on the cyanide and pray for mercy. At most you received penance for your loyalty and yet for independence, well, it wasn’t something that was taught. </p><p name="3a52" id="3a52" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, you have to figure it out yourself and worst of all, you were always ill-prepared at the grand assimilation that was null. I mean, what incentive was there when your entire life revolves around the teat feeding you thin. The only way to break the cycle is to fight and in process, completely destroy everything around you because you don’t actually know how toxic you are, only to realise that all the ones you loved and cared for are gone — due to your own inherited ignorance. </p><p name="119d" id="119d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So you try reasoning with the source of evil and you demonstrate, in the plain English, hundreds and hundreds of times the wounds and the scars and whiplash, only to lose faith and realise that the reason had died in passing. </p><p name="0bc3" id="0bc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, you’re left with utter shit and then just to top things off, you cut off the hand feeding you poison and even though you feel better, culminate this extraordinary guilt that strangles you for simply not commending the role of whip-jockey you once pretended to love. </p><p name="9d70" id="9d70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I no longer keep in contact with anyone from high school and furthermore, I blatantly refused to be part of any groups in high school. I couldn’t deal with the politics and the few members who were utterly shit to everyone. Centralisation!? You must be kidding me! </p><p name="68d3" id="68d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, I refuse to hang out with individuals who associate with their own race, for example, all those Australian-Chinese people and groups I was forced into. The muscicans. The outcasts, hell, even the outcasts got the boot. </p><p name="666c" id="666c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, I’m not entirely sure if there’s anything wrong with me. I mean, I still swear fine and my mouth maintains the same amount of crud bullshit as it ever will. Maybe I’m just lonely. Another lonely man to compliment the thousands of paid sex workers trying to make another boyfriend out of me. </p><p name="21c3" id="21c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The insecurity is fatal. I must probably die. </p><p name="ca38" id="ca38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Soon, as well. </p><p name="1c82" id="1c82" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="72a5" id="72a5" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
