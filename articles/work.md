Work isn't so bad.

It's not a complete orgy of totalitarian devastation designed to leave nothing but pus and confetti in it's undying commitment to reprogram you into a usefully well-behaved utility. Nor is it the kind of affair that dribbles you with nonsensical pleasure, lesser to the pagan beliefs you uphold as gospel, you Crinkle Cut bitch.

Rather, it's more of a mechanical duet featuring your best face and last year's palette of discount plastic cheese squares, suitably moulded into tiny matchsticks for your tongue to delight. Bacteria likes it cheap. "A matchstick a day keeps the ol' Maggie away from the heart monitor!", a somewhat delirious lie if I ever heard one, and an enticingly offensive remark considering the integrity of these tight, syncratic lips. Pour into the castle, and deliver thy swine from evil. Oh, so very evil.

Well, all of this would hold true about the sanctity of work, that is until it manages to gouge your eyes out with the edge of an disposable salad spoon, left keenly in the office kitchen as a symbol of 21st century martyr, delegated ever-so softly as a personality disorder with the perfect amount of jazz to keep leadership entertained. It's exciting, like watching a parent die in front of live television audience.

Actually I quite like work, and aside from literally being paid to make that statement, I genuinely think it's the perfect package of routine and marriage, which holds you so dearly and maintains such reverence, that you really can't help. A sense of purpose to wake up at 5:20am in the morning, only to disappoint myself later in an attempt to pry my eyes open with a miniature-sized pickaxe.

Can you taste the salt? It's everywhere. In my eyes. My lungs, oh my poor little lungs. It's a bit like trying to breathe without the glamour of knowing where exactly the oxygen is coming from. Perhaps that's just how we do it here in Cattle Country. An excellent place to adore, as well as ignore, the kinds of pertinent squalor you so profess as professional gold.

It's a beautiful sight, as I gaze out into the wild foray of desks and fibre glass upholstry shimmering in the distance. You might even consider it a blessing of sorts, a weary collection of long-term aptitude, projecting itself across the 

Crinkle n' cut, Benny boy. It's time to solder those wounds shut and call it a day. I know that's exactly how our good friend Jesus would want it. Recuperated within the space of a 10 minute smoko which clearly got waaaayyy out of hand. Keep the change sucker. It's all on me.
