### Describe Anxiety

<!--
I felt sick. Heart wretched tight. Eyes tumbled violent. Stripped. Tenderised. A hurl of mirage. A sidewalk of sausage. Mahogany. Breakfast. Fuck. My immediate vicinity. A mere outline of dissolved potential. Shapes n' sounds. Our friendly dynamic duplicit duality dynamo duo. That's right. That's right. THAT'S RIGHT! Pow! Wow! OMG!? The bread. The butter. My mouth. An explosion of yeast. Rumbles coarse through my stomach. Beautiful. Boy. Lovely. Liam. Teeth like a corroded rubber stamp. A child with a medicinal flower crown dies in an expiry of shame. Her entire body. Snapping in half. Splitting in two. The stupid moronic screaming of her delicate frame. Lungs convulsing. An unbearable dither of lousy attention-seeking bullshit. It is like choking on black ice. She is dead. Fuck her life. I attempt to run away from the trauma but the relativity pulls me back. The tear tearing torn tear you tatter tit tome. I begin touching myself uncontrollably. My hands shake rowdy. I just want to be. Let me be me. Be me be. Let.

### Describe Neighbourhood

It was dark. I'd just arrived at the Street of Plenty™, embalmed in a couldron of Anxiety™. Umbrella in hand. Happy to appear relevant in this giant boardgame of Neighbourhood™. Perhaps I'll be mugged today by a giant elf with gargantuan pointy ears, in a precious reminder to always stock up on defensive elixirs and earth-based magic. I glided my way along each house, appreciative of their Victorian terrace walls and avid continuity. In relish of their stolen Windsor ceilings, cracked and protected by the beaten Oceania of a rusted tin roof, born from an accolade of mismatch furniture and broken milk crates which sat outside on the front porch below. I pictured Milo being fucked on the worn cream couch next to the record player as she attempted to down a beer, now being ravaged from her hand as a older man pinned her down and shoved her pleasure. It's showtime, baby.

### Milo House

My finger collides with the doorbell in a punch of raw sweat, caught against a cataclysmic rift of banished motion. The air freezes. I wait. Silent. The surround of unsettling tones chortle doubt into the cone of my ear, unsympathetic in their benign intentions. A caustic shackle of nightfall paranoia befalls upon me. Weeping. Wailing. Crawling down my spine. Her mobile. I probably should have called it instead of coddling at her door, but my mind was precisely one step behind the curb in this deluge of squeaky replication. Then in a Reveille of indignant suede, my ears catch sight of an erratic stampede of footsteps from within the house. A squirrel? Then a thud. Crank. The door slams opens and a girl with pink locks and delicious bleached swirls, bursts out onto the porch in an exorbitant display of giddy laughter, falling to floor in a heave of sliced screaming, as she holds onto my thigh like a hobbled piece of fried chicken. I take a step back. She stops. Laughs. Turns onto her stomach and looks up at me from the floor below with a delirious smile of incapacitated charm. Refactoring wildly. Contorting mad. She continues to eye me as she licks her lips with a silicone grin, as if to reminder herself that she even had lips at all. The result of a fistful of hard drugs and a fatherless upbringing. Probably LSD. I was intrigued. Although not intrigued enough to drop everything and begin fucking her on the floor. She could be fucked later.

"Arent you thhee kind man." I didn't really understand what she was trying to say, although I didn't expect anything less. It was a compliment without the compliment, best served with corned beef. She was the kind of lonely attraction which encouraged date rape as an ample coping mechanism to help her deal with her crippling anxiety. A fatal transit of state-wide inhibition and bad breath. For some unknown reason, that turned me on. The male and his jailbait, sharing a cold meal in the back of an outback diner, ready to pull n' tease with a line of coke at ease. I step over her fancy body and into the scope of the hallway, turning an immediate right into what appeared to be the kitchen. I find Milo leaning extensibly over the kitchen sink, decorated in thigh-high knitted socks which continued onto the outskirts of her pink-lace pantyhose. Seemingly, the only sane person in this shared imagination. Well, that was until I witnessed her take out a week-old tampon from her vagina, before reinserting it back in without even a dally of care. I mean, did she really have to mention how old the thing was? Well, of course she did. Because I'm a perv and she knew it too. Our marriage would be grand.

### Milo Realisation

"How's it goin', stranger?", she concurred, as she bent herself over the crest of her cross, struggling to the maintain the tight fitting of her torn leggings. Hair in a Preston Louise. Faulty. Passing me a sedated wink of comical misunderstanding, her vulpine sweater dressed in a cherubic liquor of black tar. With a cigarette in her left and a marty shoelace in the other, I stood there slouched and I observed her for at least a few seconds, evermore clear that Milo was undeniably stunning in worst possible way. Nothing about her existence offered purity, nor sanctity, in the deformed cane of substance abuse which was paper-thin body, keen to protrude my misgiving penis through her shriveled stomach lining. Yet although I could feel the rejection in my heart, attempting to refute the grotesque husk of flea-infested cum leaning before me, I couldn't stop staring at her, in what was neither a feeling of abhorrence, nor attraction. Only a rugged refusal to dismantle the fantasy of sex and pleasure I'd upheld of her stature for so incredibly long, that I couldn't even tell if it was what I truly wanted anymore. In a lot of ways, she was simply a more evolved female version of myself, determined in the self-hate which it dignified through drugs and enclitic spire. Truth was that I simply didn't have the intellect, nor courage, to approach my own desperation and loneliness beyond the women I threw myself at. All I wanted was to create the impression that I was worth at least someone's attention, even that of my own. Hopefully, she would let me hold her hand.

### Milo Conversation

"Only slightly suicidal. I think I bumped into your friend at the door. Is she going to be okay? She's currently flailing on the patio singing an ol' Groucho Marx tune." I hear further groaning in the background. Clearly she's in need of desperate attention.

"It's only Ketamine. She's down to twice a week now, so I think she'll be fine for tonight." An expert opinion from the premiere of expertise itself. Welcome to reality, rundle kitches, where absolutely nothing makes sense. Have a milky bar, kid. The calcium is good for you. Her shoelaces now tight around her military ankle, the cat was ready pounce. She lights up another cigarette, struts towards me and exhales a plume of irradiated smoke. Kissing me on the lips in a femme fatale of provocative aorism. She curls her right leg around mine, kicking my excitement into full-gear. The light was here and it was my time to shine.

"What do you say we head out to the city? My shout."

## Scene 2 START - out

### Walking with Milo

I place my tongue around my neck, embracing the flavoured tinnitus of a dappled arcadia as it pours from her mouth in an indecipherable madness of paradoxical immorality. Trickling in it's unmarked presence; slurring from the finite retro-carbon of her meaningless aspersion. Enveloping my reality in a bisectional preference for radical peversity, subtle in it's precipice like a hit of Marsden crack along the primrose of my gums. Vial. Flippo. Shatter. The laughter and it's black dress. Overflowing with a suicidal ideation drawing blood from the seamstress of common ivy, swallowing my lungs whole in a lovey-dovey vacuum of galt premonition. Limbering in the illegible quiver of a sex-deprived addict. Prerogative. Fool. "Like tryin' ta squash Lego into squelched antelope," they say. Racin' down the ranch and into the bright yellow pit of ethically-sourced adrenaline, marked unerring with tins of italicised road paint. White. White. Red. Voracious to impress her ribbon-like waist with a good ol' whack-a-mole-ay. A glory hole. A finger nail. Amble in the meandering sway of my viscious claws, anxious to hold her broken hands and call her princess amongst a cavalier of the nice, pretty things. I wanted to give her the complete collection and more.
-->

Our footsteps waded through the thick musk of the dusk harbor bay, born from a concurrent desire to breathe. Unnaturally caulked in the cultural silhouette of an Indian family affair playing "Daddy knows best" in a cultural scamper of domestic heirarchy. Daddy picks child. Up. Shouts in foreign. Language. Mummy stands tall. Waiting. Thinking about Korma, because I'm a racist fuck with a horrible binge.  The cigarette falls from my mouth, breaking my train of thought. A suitably romantic scene, if not a touch endearing, I think to myself. I look up into the night sky. Barely here, nor there. The clouds. Amiss in their wretched drudgery. Shrouding their eerie ways into the whispering winds and creeping shadows of their distant forefathers, lurking and melding into the fragmented movement our veins and loath left behinnd. Refracting upon the crayon surface of the cautious river below. Thankfully, it was just enough to convince her to latch onto my hand, as she pressed her body against my shoulder, something which I'd been thinking about since we first met. Milo was cute. A cat. A cutie cat.

And although I could tell that I was becoming derranged in my hunger for self-acceptance, that crucial element holding me together, it was a much better feeling than lying in my bed, sulking over the metaphysical appearances of the world. I suppose I'd always been afraid of this moment, where man meets women, carried by the heavy hands of fate onto something greater. Where the expectation was loud and vast, ripping itself methodologically into the grain of your skin, scolding bone as a consequence of childish demeanor. I needed to express myself, if only to get closer to the woman I adored like mulched grape seed. Give me your pulp, you bitch.

### Sodomy monologue

"There's something fantastic about sodomy." A religious travesty of heightened caution, equivalent to strapping on some C4, running into traffic and blowing up an entire school bus full of children. Limbs akimbo. Blood in vicious tandem. Blooms of crisp trigonometry, pouring down and around and around onto the dusty streets below. An indecent cascade of ceremony upon the land of Jakarta, but at least the shrapnel of a half-blown up dick didn't happen to enter the mouth of another child, because that would have taken the already-tragedy to unprecedented highs. The news speaks. The people are outraged. Fragments of the bus are placed on trial. Buses are soon banned and really I hoped Milo was absolutely loving this routine, because it truly was key to her liking me.

"You really are evil, aren't you?", utters Milo, as she detaches from my arm, keen to skip about on the side walk. A-twirl in her own world of disturbing fascination. I could never quite tell what she was thinking, nor whether she was scheming against me, nor whom with. But it felt awfully as if I were being plucked from the herd for my blatant gullibility, a trait which I heralded as a quirky coping mechanism to be admired, now sinking me in a latrine of quibble speculation. She looks at me with wide-open eyes, tautologically drawing the outline of my torso with her plymouth tongue slithered inbetween her teeth. Inconsummate in the indecision bleeding from her mouth.

"I try my best," I remarked, hoping to sound lost in my own intellectuality. Obviously, inundated in an air of desperation I'd simply accepted as a premium feature of my personality, as was perfectly clear in my hilarious inability to even hold eye-contact. Undeniably, I'd softened a little too much to her charm, although how could one control it? This jester holds no hands. Eventually, we arrived at our destination. An establishment of entertainment. The local river 'pub'. I'm sure I could have paid a higher price for my enthusaism, although my broker was short on options.

### At Bar



The deafening reverberation of broken noise clashed against the senses.

, the singing cheers and alcoholic folly of the bar left open a new a generation of patrons to falter and despair, clashing slovenly against the senses in an agonising huff of futility. It was clear who had become adjusted to the rein, those blacked out youth in their cordoroy t-shirts and labelled affair, justifying confidence with another stint at the bar. A drunken man swerves around me, smashing his head into the Irish trims lacing their way around the liquor tetrohedron of doom. There's a particular mistress in every bar.


"Man, where do they find these women," I shout, knowing full-well that no one can hear me. I see Milo head to the bar, flirting with the waitress, before turning her head towards me with sharp smirk and a brief sneer in her eye, as if to suggest that I had some part to play

I always felt out of place at bars. Not that it felt artificial, but it's not the kind of place you would live in, so why would you want to hang out there?

Milo comes over with two pints of cider and a
I down my first shot.

I can feel her grabbing at my pants. It was wild.

### Dance Together



Admittedly, I was never much of an alcohol kind of guy. I always

<!-- When they have sex, he can't cum. -->

I wanted her more than anything else in the world.

### Describe Feelings

I'm covered in the silk of my own drool. She's right besides me. It was perfect. She was perfect. The perfect outline of me. Everything my heart desired in the punishing impulsiveness which was her fabled dreamscape of a errorless body. Those perky nipples,

Even to this day, I have no possible idea how we managed to get home in the state that we were in, however

### Describe Sex

She pushed me into the front door. We started making out. Her tongue against mine. Guiding me without evidence. She pushes her torso against mine, reaching for my pants. This is what I wanted. This is who she was, and this is what I'd dreamed of experiencing from the moment I saw her.

We reach my bedroom. I couldn't stop looking into her eyes. In a sense, I couldn't tell if she happy, sad . It was as if she was . As if deep down inside she was actually mentally running away from herself. From her life, and I was merely an outlet for it all.

She gets on top of me.




## Scene 1 START

### Expressing love

An acoustic stream of pink decorations fluttered around me, gently letting me down ina a confetti of fairy dust. I couldn't have imagined anything more perfect than the sanctuary of her presence, held in esteem beyond the very words which brought her to life. More than anything, I simply wanted to hold her in my hand, pretending to be hers in every sense of the word. A lucky charm of eternity which

I could have stared at her for hours, absorbing the finer details of her skin. Hold her tight

The perfect image of cuckholdry

I could feel her body pressed against mine. The soft touch of her pores



So this is what love was. A pure evaporation if cynicism, .


. It was like staring at a godess.


She's distant.

### Waking up with Milo

 I was ecstatic.

The air was thin this morning. It had been quite cold recently, and I wasn't quite sure

"I think I have a condition."

"Fuck, you don't have syphilis, do you?", she spouted in an over-reaction of concern, hugging the bed-sheets in a last bastion of earthly safety.

"Oh no, it's not that.

"Try and talk about your mental il=ln

### Talk about making breakfast together.

"Wet cake makes for a soppy treat," she announces, floating her way to the heel of my toes, t-shirt draped across her bare shoulders.

### Breaking point.

(maybe make it about trust issues)

## Scene 2 START


### The breakup.

"I don't think I can do this anymore. I like you n' all, and I think you're a really smart and funny guy, but you're just not really my type."

My first reaction was to vomit. Either because I felt I deserved the pain of wretching my guts out, or because I felt so sick that I didn't know how else to respond.


 How does one feel rejection when they already live and breathe it by mere fracture of their existence?

"What do you mean? What more is there than being smart or funny?", I recited, following a long careful examination of the situation. Truth was, I was devastated.


### She leaves.

My first reaction once she'd left was to masturbate. It was remained in the sunken realisation that all hope had decided to evade me, leaving my corspe in a discoloured

It was what comforted me. Showed me peace. Helped soften the blow of having

Careful not to think, I picked myself up and slowly
