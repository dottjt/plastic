### Describe Anxiety

<!--
I felt sick. Heart wretched tight. Eyes tumbled violent. Stripped. Tenderised. A hurl of mirage. A sidewalk of sausage. Mahogany. Breakfast. Fuck. My immediate vicinity. A mere outline of dissolved potential. Shapes n' sounds. Our friendly dynamic duplicit duality dynamo duo. That's right. That's right. THAT'S RIGHT! Pow! Wow! OMG!? The bread. The butter. My mouth. An explosion of yeast. Rumbles coarse through my stomach. Beautiful. Boy. Lovely. Liam. Teeth like a corroded rubber stamp. A child with a medicinal flower crown dies in an expiry of shame. Her entire body. Snapping in half. Splitting in two. The stupid moronic screaming of her delicate frame. Lungs convulsing. An unbearable dither of lousy attention-seeking bullshit. It is like choking on black ice. She is dead. Fuck her life. I attempt to run away from the trauma but the relativity pulls me back. The tear tearing torn tear you tatter tit tome. I begin touching myself uncontrollably. My hands shake rowdy. I just want to be. Let me be me. Be me be. Let.

### Describe Neighbourhood

It was dark. I'd just arrived at the Street of Plenty™, embalmed in a couldron of Anxiety™. Umbrella in hand. Happy to appear relevant in this giant boardgame of Neighbourhood™. Perhaps I'll be mugged today by a giant elf with gargantuan pointy ears, in a precious reminder to always stock up on defensive elixirs and earth-based magic. I glided my way along each house, appreciative of their Victorian terrace walls and avid continuity. In relish of their stolen Windsor ceilings, cracked and protected by the beaten Oceania of a rusted tin roof, born from an accolade of mismatch furniture and broken milk crates which sat outside on the front porch below. I pictured Milo being fucked on the worn cream couch next to the record player as she attempted to down a beer, now being ravaged from her hand as a older man pinned her down and shoved her pleasure. It's showtime, baby.

### Milo House

My finger collides with the doorbell in a punch of raw sweat, caught against a cataclysmic rift of banished motion. The air freezes. I wait. Silent. The surround of unsettling tones chortle doubt into the cone of my ear, unsympathetic in their benign intentions. A caustic shackle of nightfall paranoia befalls upon me. Weeping. Wailing. Crawling down my spine. Her mobile. I probably should have called it instead of coddling at her door, but my mind was precisely one step behind the curb in this deluge of squeaky replication. Then in a Reveille of indignant suede, my ears catch sight of an erratic stampede of footsteps from within the house. A squirrel? Then a thud. Crank. The door slams opens and a girl with pink locks and delicious bleached swirls, bursts out onto the porch in an exorbitant display of giddy laughter, falling to floor in a heave of sliced screaming, as she holds onto my thigh like a hobbled piece of fried chicken. I take a step back. She stops. Laughs. Turns onto her stomach and looks up at me from the floor below with a delirious smile of incapacitated charm. Refactoring wildly. Contorting mad. She continues to eye me as she licks her lips with a silicone grin, as if to reminder herself that she even had lips at all. The result of a fistful of hard drugs and a fatherless upbringing. Probably LSD. I was intrigued. Although not intrigued enough to drop everything and begin fucking her on the floor. She could be fucked later.

"Arent you thhee kind man." I didn't really understand what she was trying to say, although I didn't expect anything less. It was a compliment without the compliment, best served with corned beef. She was the kind of lonely attraction which encouraged date rape as an ample coping mechanism to help her deal with her crippling anxiety. A fatal transit of state-wide inhibition and bad breath. For some unknown reason, that turned me on. The male and his jailbait, sharing a cold meal in the back of an outback diner, ready to pull n' tease with a line of coke at ease. I step over her fancy body and into the scope of the hallway, turning an immediate right into what appeared to be the kitchen. I find Milo leaning extensibly over the kitchen sink, decorated in thigh-high knitted socks which continued onto the outskirts of her pink-lace pantyhose. Seemingly, the only sane person in this shared imagination. Well, that was until I witnessed her take out a week-old tampon from her vagina, before reinserting it back in without even a dally of care. I mean, did she really have to mention how old the thing was? Well, of course she did. Because I'm a perv and she knew it too. Our marriage would be grand.

### Milo Realisation

"How's it goin', stranger?", she concurred, as she bent herself over the crest of her cross, struggling to the maintain the tight fitting of her torn leggings. Hair in a Preston Louise. Faulty. Passing me a sedated wink of comical misunderstanding, her vulpine sweater dressed in a cherubic liquor of black tar. With a cigarette in her left and a marty shoelace in the other, I stood there slouched and I observed her for at least a few seconds, evermore clear that Milo was undeniably stunning in worst possible way. Nothing about her existence offered purity, nor sanctity, in the deformed cane of substance abuse which was paper-thin body, keen to protrude my misgiving penis through her shriveled stomach lining. Yet although I could feel the rejection in my heart, attempting to refute the grotesque husk of flea-infested cum leaning before me, I couldn't stop staring at her, in what was neither a feeling of abhorrence, nor attraction. Only a rugged refusal to dismantle the fantasy of sex and pleasure I'd upheld of her stature for so incredibly long, that I couldn't even tell if it was what I truly wanted anymore. In a lot of ways, she was simply a more evolved female version of myself, determined in the self-hate which it dignified through drugs and enclitic spire. Truth was that I simply didn't have the intellect, nor courage, to approach my own desperation and loneliness beyond the women I threw myself at. All I wanted was to create the impression that I was worth at least someone's attention, even that of my own. Hopefully, she would let me hold her hand.

### Milo Conversation

"Only slightly suicidal. I think I bumped into your friend at the door. Is she going to be okay? She's currently flailing on the patio singing an ol' Groucho Marx tune." I hear further groaning in the background. Clearly she's in need of desperate attention.

"It's only Ketamine. She's down to twice a week now, so I think she'll be fine for tonight." An expert opinion from the premiere of expertise itself. Welcome to reality, rundle kitches, where absolutely nothing makes sense. Have a milky bar, kid. The calcium is good for you. Her shoelaces now tight around her military ankle, the cat was ready pounce. She lights up another cigarette, struts towards me and exhales a plume of irradiated smoke. Kissing me on the lips in a femme fatale of provocative aorism. She curls her right leg around mine, kicking my excitement into full-gear. The light was here and it was my time to shine.

"What do you say we head out to the city? My shout."

## Scene 2 START - out

### Describe Romance

I place my tongue around my neck, embracing the flavoured tinnitus of a dappled arcadia as it pours from her mouth in an indecipherable madness of paradoxical immorality. Trickling in it's unmarked presence; slurring from the finite retro-carbon of her meaningless aspersion. Enveloping my reality in a bisectional preference for radical peversity, subtle in it's precipice like a hit of Marsden crack along the primrose of my gums. Vial. Flippo. Shatter. The laughter and it's black dress. Overflowing with a suicidal ideation drawing blood from the seamstress of common ivy, swallowing my lungs whole in a lovey-dovey vacuum of galt premonition. Limbering in the illegible quiver of a sex-deprived addict. Prerogative. Fool. "Like tryin' ta squash Lego into squelched antelope," they say. Racin' down the ranch and into the bright yellow pit of ethically-sourced adrenaline, marked unerring with tins of italicised road paint. White. White. Red. Voracious to impress her ribbon-like waist with a good ol' whack-a-mole-ay. A glory hole. A finger nail. Amble in the meandering sway of my viscious claws, anxious to hold her broken hands and call her princess amongst a cavalier of the nice, pretty things. I wanted to give her the complete collection and more.

Our footsteps wade through the thick musk of the dusk harbor bay, born from a concurrent desire to breathe. Subserviently caulked in the cultural silhouette of an Indian family affair, playing Daddy knows best in a cultural scamper of domestic heirarchy. Daddy picks child. Up. Shouts in a foreign. Language. Mummy stands tall. Waiting. Thinkin' about Korma n' spicy dough, cause I'm a racist fuck with a horrible binge. The cigarette falls from my mouth, breaking my train of thought. The scene, was suitably romantic, if not a touch endearing. At the very least it was quiche. I look up into the night sky. Barely here, nor there. The clouds. Amiss in their wretched drudgery. Shrouding their eerie ways into the whispering winds and creeping shadows of their distant forefathers, lurking and melding into the fragmented movement our veins loathed behind. Refracting upon the crayon surface of the cautious river below. Shimmering. Just enough to convince her to latch onto my hand, as she pressed her tight body against the elevation of my shoulder, something which I'd been thinking about since the day we first met. Milo was cute. A cutie cat. My pernicious. A respendence of next-day regret. Perfect. My eyes flicker. It was obvious I was becoming derranged in my hunger for self-acceptance. That vital element of integrity which I assumed held me together, however it was vastly preferred to the alternative of lying on my bed, sulking over the metaphysical appearances of this awful world. I wanted more than to be me.

### Sodomy Monologue

"There's something fantastic about sodomy." A religious travesty of heightened caution, equivalent to strapping on a vest of Indonesian C4 to your God-given body, running into traffic and blowing up an entire defenseless bus full of Malaysian school children. Limbs akimbo. Blood in vicious tandem. Blooms of crisp trigonometry, pouring down and around and around onto the streets of Kuala Lumpur below. An indecent cascade of ceremony upon the world's most egregious constitutional monarch, service to the public's desire for law and order, but at least the shrapnel of a half blown-up dick didn't happen to enter the gaping asshole of another dead child's corpse, because that would have been an absolute tragedy beyond the unprecedented death we have all witnessed here today. The council speaks. The news apprehends. The people are outraged. Fragments of the bus are placed on trial and buses are soon banned in a collective attempt to prevent the inevitable. Milo smiles. My heart feels warm. I truly hoped she enjoyed that routine, because it was key to her liking me. Not just as the guy at her desk telling jokes like it's 1999, but also as a lover at the end of her bed, eating her out in a diseased frenzy free-for-all.

"You really are evil, aren't you?", utters Milo, as she detaches away from my arm. Keen to skip about on the side walk next to the vulval flow of the night river glow, a-twirl in her own dark grave of disturbing fascination. I could never quite tell what she was thinking in these moments of glee. Whether she was scheming with me or against me. Nor necessarily with whom. But it felt awfully as if she'd arbitrarily plucked me from the herd to be briefly admired for my weak-willed courage to persist with her unbalance, only to be soon discarded and thrown away once my overbearingness had become too much to touch. A trait which I had heralded as a quirky coping mechanism to be aligned with, only to realise in a distant episode that it had been sinking me at my feet this entire time, drowning me in a latrine of my own quibbled speculation. I was dust boy, and she was my dustpan mistress. Sweeping me up for my own good, so I could be reacquianted with the of bin silence which would rapidly assemble the beginnings of an uncontrollable depression.

For a moment she sparks. I don't understand why, but I enjoy the attention. She turns her head towards me with her eyes wide-open, tautologically drawing the outline of my torso with the edge of her tongue. Now delicately slithered in-between her teeth in a plymouth hunger of pneumatic tension. Inconsummate, like a tailor of indecision bleeding sour from her gums. Ideologically opposed. Delinquent. I suppose I'd always been afraid of this moment. Where man meets women and woman embraces man in an underground cavern of sexual theatre. Woman is clubbed. Woman is raped. Woman gives birth and life continues it's viscous cycle until we eventually achieve some semblance of balance. A union of civil rights and divorce. Leading us to present day. Ground zero. An uncanny valley of gore and racism where not even the sweetest of words are enough to impress the discarded packaging of a Japanese sex doll. The blaring loudness of expectation resumes it's mighty roar. Manhood. Lost. The pressure rips itself methodologically through the grain of your skin, scolding bone as a consequence of your own childish demeanor. Aching and breaking you. Leaving you sad and alone. Longing for expression. Attempting to prove itself in a smear of naked adoration, like a slaw of mulched grape seed chutney slobbered upon a senior's breakfast pantaloon. She was my main course and I was absolutely dying to chew. Give me your pulp, bitch. Give me your whore.

I make another pointless comment, hoping to sound lost within my own intellectuality. It fails. Inundating the air with a clear sense of desperation. Another flaw I'd simply come to accept as a premium feature of my own personality, revealing itself in my obvious inability to hold eye-contact. A jester without his hands. The tally is revised. She is bored and I am one step closer to sitting alone in my apartment, contemplating suicide as I eat a half-frozen meatpie in front of my computer monitor. Wanking. Lying about how truly happy I am to my therapist. Thankfully, we'd just arrived at our destination for the evening. An establishment of entertainment. A pub with a Scottish name. I presume it was written in some form of Gaelic, although I had no bloody idea. It was an irrelevant detail I was wasting my mind on. I just wanted a drink.

### At Bar

Rock n' roll n' nicotine patches. The immediate reverberation of the in-house band pummels me into a two-bit amplitude of broken distortion, rupturing my canals into a jackhammer aftermath of smashed rubble and narcoleptic disorientation. Commencing what would be a post-traumatic ringing in my ears which would be felt well into the early hours of tomorrow morning, churning meekly at the cones and rods shaken in my harrowing plea for homely subsistence. I needed a drink. The head honco flips her middle finger at me in a French occupation of swivel inebriation; teenage angst at wholesale prices, palpitating down in the antic mul of the pub jeer. I take a moment to glare into the sparsity of the sloven crowd before me, cashed up in an alcoholic folly of Saturday night disrepair. Cheering against the rein. Those blacked out youth in their cordoroy t-shirts and labelled affair, justifying confidence with another able-bodied stint at the bar. Some drunken fuck swerves into me in a looseless-nancy, smashing his head onto the oak hardwood of the bar top besides me. Lacing it's way around the room in a liquor tetrohedron of doom, as the blood drew mess from his fractured skull. I knew I'd come to the right place, even though I'd much rather be at home. Moments before finishing off a late-night wank, ready to head to bed.

"Man, where do they find these people?", I shout, knowing full-well that no one can hear me. I can tell Milo feels at home, here amongst the appetizing trash of kitsch puritance. She steps over the drunken fuck, flirts with a waitress with dark eyeliner, before turning her head towards me with sharp smirk and a brief sneer. As if to suggest that I had some part to play in this scene. She begins chatting away with the bartender. I think they kiss. Then seemingly, she disappears completely from my sight, carried away by a torrent of desperate patrons bidding for another pint. Admittedly, I'd always felt out of place at bars. Not that it felt artificial, but it didn't really fit my image of a romance. Ideally, where we'd both lay there sulking in a dark room together, cutting our wrists and acting like dumb teenagers with an insecurity for how we looked. Clearly, there was a huge part of my childhood that I'd missed out on. Milo comes over with two pints of cider and a Wet Pussy.

"This is for you, soldier. I've already had mine," she berates, as I down my first shot, my hearing now deteriorating to that of a 5 year old. 


I can feel her grabbing at my pants. It was wild.

Undeniably, I'd softened a little too much to her charm, although how could one control it?

### Dance Together



Admittedly, I was never much of an alcohol kind of guy. I always

<!-- When they have sex, he can't cum. -->

I wanted her more than anything else in the world.

### Describe Feelings

I'm covered in the silk of my own drool. She's right besides me. It was perfect. She was perfect. The perfect outline of me. Everything my heart desired in the punishing impulsiveness which was her fabled dreamscape of a errorless body. Those perky nipples,

Even to this day, I have no possible idea how we managed to get home in the state that we were in, however

### Describe Sex

She pushed me into the front door. We started making out. Her tongue against mine. Guiding me without evidence. She pushes her torso against mine, reaching for my pants. This is what I wanted. This is who she was, and this is what I'd dreamed of experiencing from the moment I saw her.

We reach my bedroom. I couldn't stop looking into her eyes. In a sense, I couldn't tell if she happy, sad . It was as if she was . As if deep down inside she was actually mentally running away from herself. From her life, and I was merely an outlet for it all.

She gets on top of me.




## Scene 1 START

### Expressing love

An acoustic stream of pink decorations fluttered around me, gently letting me down ina a confetti of fairy dust. I couldn't have imagined anything more perfect than the sanctuary of her presence, held in esteem beyond the very words which brought her to life. More than anything, I simply wanted to hold her in my hand, pretending to be hers in every sense of the word. A lucky charm of eternity which

I could have stared at her for hours, absorbing the finer details of her skin. Hold her tight

The perfect image of cuckholdry

I could feel her body pressed against mine. The soft touch of her pores



So this is what love was. A pure evaporation if cynicism, .


. It was like staring at a godess.


She's distant.

### Waking up with Milo

 I was ecstatic.

The air was thin this morning. It had been quite cold recently, and I wasn't quite sure

"I think I have a condition."

"Fuck, you don't have syphilis, do you?", she spouted in an over-reaction of concern, hugging the bed-sheets in a last bastion of earthly safety.

"Oh no, it's not that.

"Try and talk about your mental il=ln

### Talk about making breakfast together.

"Wet cake makes for a soppy treat," she announces, floating her way to the heel of my toes, t-shirt draped across her bare shoulders.

### Breaking point.

(maybe make it about trust issues)

## Scene 2 START


### The breakup.

"I don't think I can do this anymore. I like you n' all, and I think you're a really smart and funny guy, but you're just not really my type."

My first reaction was to vomit. Either because I felt I deserved the pain of wretching my guts out, or because I felt so sick that I didn't know how else to respond.


 How does one feel rejection when they already live and breathe it by mere fracture of their existence?

"What do you mean? What more is there than being smart or funny?", I recited, following a long careful examination of the situation. Truth was, I was devastated.


### She leaves.

My first reaction once she'd left was to masturbate. It was remained in the sunken realisation that all hope had decided to evade me, leaving my corspe in a discoloured

It was what comforted me. Showed me peace. Helped soften the blow of having

Careful not to think, I picked myself up and slowly
