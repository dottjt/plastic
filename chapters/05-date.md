### Describe Anxiety

<!--
I felt sick. Heart wretched tight. Eyes tumbled violent. Stripped. Tenderised. A hurl of mirage. A sidewalk of sausage. Mahogany. Breakfast. Fuck. My immediate vicinity. A mere outline of dissolved potential. Shapes n' sounds. Our friendly dynamic duplicit duality dynamo duo. That's right. That's right. THAT'S RIGHT! Pow! Wow! OMG!? The bread. The butter. My mouth. An explosion of yeast. Rumbles coarse through my stomach. Beautiful. Boy. Lovely. Liam. Teeth like a corroded rubber stamp. A child with a medicinal flower crown dies in an expiry of shame. Her entire body. Snapping in half. Splitting in two. The stupid moronic screaming of her delicate frame. Lungs convulsing. An unbearable dither of lousy attention-seeking bullshit. It is like choking on black ice. She is dead. Fuck her life. I attempt to run away from the trauma but the relativity pulls me back. The tear tearing torn tear you tatter tit tome. I begin touching myself uncontrollably. My hands shake rowdy. I just want to be. Let me be me. Be me be. Let.

### Describe Neighbourhood

It was dark. I'd just arrived at the Street of Plenty™, embalmed in a couldron of Anxiety™. Umbrella in hand. Happy to appear relevant in this giant boardgame of Neighbourhood™. Perhaps I'll be mugged today by a giant elf with gargantuan pointy ears, in a precious reminder to always stock up on defensive elixirs and earth-based magic. I glided my way along each house, appreciative of their Victorian terrace walls and avid continuity. In relish of their stolen Windsor ceilings, cracked and protected by the beaten Oceania of a rusted tin roof, born from an accolade of mismatch furniture and broken milk crates which sat outside on the front porch below. I pictured Milo being fucked on the worn cream couch next to the record player as she attempted to down a beer, now being ravaged from her hand as a older man pinned her down and shoved her pleasure. It's showtime, baby.

### Milo House
-->

My finger collides with the doorbell in a punch of raw sweat, caught in a deep wisp of banished motion. The air freezes. I wait. Silent. As I stand there surrounded by the unsettling tones chortling doubt into the cone of my ear, unsympathetically unkind in their benign intentions. Intertwined in a caustic shackle of nightfall paranoia. Weeping. Wailing. Crawling down my spine. Her mobile. I probably should have called it instead of coddling her door, but my mind was precisely one step behind the curb. A deluge of squeaky application. Then in a military Reveille of indignant suede, I begin to hear an erratic stampede of footsteps from within the house. A squirrel? Then a thud. Crank. The door slams opens and a girl with pink locks and bleached swirls, bursts out onto the porch in an exorbitant display of giddy laughter. Falling to floor in a heave of paniced screaming, as she grab my leg like a hobbled piece of fried chicken. I take a step back. She stops. Laughs. Turns onto her stomach and looks up at me from the floor below with a delirious smile of incapacitated charm. Refactoring wildly. Contorting madly. As she licks her lips with a silicone grin, as if to reminder herself that her lips were even there at all. The result of a bag of hard drugs and a fatherless upbrining. Probably LSD. I was intrigued. Although she could be fucked later, perhaps if Milo had given up on me. I had bigger fish to fry.

"Arent you thhee kind man." I didn't really understand what she was trying to say, although it sounded a bit like a half-baked compliment. I'm sure she was the kind of girl who encouraged date rape in order to help her cope with the crippling anxiety causing her inability to express.


 I step over her body and into the hallway, turnning an immediate right, where I find Milo leaning extensibly on the kitchen sink, decorated in thigh-high knitted socks which continued into the outskirts of her pink-lace pantyhose. Seemingly, the only sane person in this entire house. Well, that was until I witnessed her take out, as well as reinsert a week-old tampon in front of my very eyes. I mean, why did she even have to tell me the duration of the thing. Perhaps we were already married.

### Milo Realisation

"How's it going, stranger?", she signalled, passing me a sedated wink of comical desire, as she struggled to pull her leggings up. Admittedly, standing here in this room, I felt undecided about her existence. It was neither a feel of abhorrence, nor attraction. Only a failure to recognise why I was truly here, conflict against the fantasy I had upheld of her stature for so incredibly long. Chances were that I simply didn't want to recognise the grotesque husk of flea-infested cum standing in front of me, reeking of a black tar which even fracking itself could not produce. And yet, as I abhored her, I was reminded of the fact that she was simply a female version of me, and arguably I simply hated myself. Then it occurred to me that I simply didn't have the courage to approach my own desperation and loneliness beyond the women I threw myself at, if only to create the impression that I was worth at least someone's attention. Hopefully, she would let me hold her hand.

### Milo Conversation

"Not too bad. I bumped into your friend at the door, are they going to be okay? I think she's on the front patio, laughing at a ladybug." She seemed unconcerned.

"Oh yeah. It's only Ketamine. She's been on it twice a week now for quite a while now, so I would say she's safe." An expert opinion an expert soul. Welcome to reality, where nothing makes sense and everyone around you whoring for that wonderful fuck-stick of disgression.

### Milo Sexual/Leave

She lights up a cigarette, strutting towards me. Exhaling before kissing me on the lips. She curls her leg around mine, kicking my excitement into full-gear as the relevancy became relevant. The light was here and it was my time to shine. I wanted to fuck her so bad.

"What do you say we head out to the city? My shout."


 I embraced myself for a wholesome night of flavoured tinnitus and unmarked glory holes. Ready to impress her paper-thin waist with a good ol' whack-a-moleay.

## Scene 2 START

### Sodomy monologue

There's something fantastic about sodomy. A religious travesty of heightened caution, no different to blowing up a entire school bus full of Indonesian school children, limbs akimbo, crisp sheets of trigonometry pouring down in a cascade of ceremony, only to condemn those who practice formal expression in a much, much less formal way.

"You really are evil, aren't you?" says Milo, skipping about on the side walk, a-twirl in her own world of disturbing imagination of primary fascination. A curious beast I one-day hoped to tame and unleash, like a feel-good tsunami of sexual domination. Clearly, you didn't need to hear that.

"It's just a joke," I remarked, a light teaser of things to come, hoping to sound lost in my own intellectuality, obviously inundated in an air of desperation I'd simply accepted as the lonely cousin following me around everywhere. Undeniably I'd softened to her

### Walk down the promenade

The harbor atmosphere, caulked in the silhouette of a family galore, witnessing a domestic episode of "dad knows best", was suitably romantic, if not a touch endearing. As I looked up at the night sky, it was clear that the clouds were amiss in their treachery, shrouding their eerie ways into the whispering wind and creeping shadows, lurking and melding themselves into our fragmented movement refracting against the crayon river below. Thankfully it was just enough to convince her to hold my hand, something which I'd been thinking about since we first met.

Milo looked at me with wide-open eyes, tautologically drawing the outline of my torso with her tongue slithered between her teeth, incommensurable in her indecision she treated like a cute afterthought. I could never quite tell what it was she was scheming, nor whom with. But it felt awfully as if I were being plucked from the herd for my blatant gullibility, a trait which I heralded as a quirky coping mechanism to be admired, now sinking me in a latrine of quibble speculation.

### Talks abous relationship

I'd always been afraid of this moment, where man meets women, carried by the heavy hands of fate onto something greater. Where the expectation was loud and vast, ripping itself methodologically into the grain of your skin, scolding bone as a consequence of childish demeanor.

"Very funny," I noted in extreme caution, knowing full-well that there was a 1 in 10 chance that her flirtatious actions could result in a round of heated bathroom sex, unfortunate for the disabled sod in a 60s' wheel chair holding on for dear life to the ambient noise of sexual wear n' tear.

### At Bar

The deafening reverberation of broken noise clashed against the senses.

, the singing cheers and alcoholic folly of the bar left open a new a generation of patrons to falter and despair, clashing slovenly against the senses in an agonising huff of futility. It was clear who had become adjusted to the rein, those blacked out youth in their cordoroy t-shirts and labelled affair, justifying confidence with another stint at the bar. A drunken man swerves around me, smashing his head into the Irish trims lacing their way around the liquor tetrohedron of doom. There's a particular mistress in every bar.


"Man, where do they find these women," I shout, knowing full-well that no one can hear me. I see Milo head to the bar, flirting with the waitress, before turning her head towards me with sharp smirk and a brief sneer in her eye, as if to suggest that I had some part to play

I always felt out of place at bars. Not that it felt artificial, but it's not the kind of place you would live in, so why would you want to hang out there?

Milo comes over with two pints of cider and a
I down my first shot.

I can feel her grabbing at my pants. It was wild.

### Dance Together



Admittedly, I was never much of an alcohol kind of guy. I always

<!-- When they have sex, he can't cum. -->

I wanted her more than anything else in the world.

### Describe Feelings

I'm covered in the silk of my own drool. She's right besides me. It was perfect. She was perfect. The perfect outline of me. Everything my heart desired in the punishing impulsiveness which was her fabled dreamscape of a errorless body. Those perky nipples,

Even to this day, I have no possible idea how we managed to get home in the state that we were in, however

### Describe Sex

She pushed me into the front door. We started making out. Her tongue against mine. Guiding me without evidence. She pushes her torso against mine, reaching for my pants. This is what I wanted. This is who she was, and this is what I'd dreamed of experiencing from the moment I saw her.

We reach my bedroom. I couldn't stop looking into her eyes. In a sense, I couldn't tell if she happy, sad . It was as if she was . As if deep down inside she was actually mentally running away from herself. From her life, and I was merely an outlet for it all.

She gets on top of me.




## Scene 1 START

### Expressing love

An acoustic stream of pink decorations fluttered around me, gently letting me down ina a confetti of fairy dust. I couldn't have imagined anything more perfect than the sanctuary of her presence, held in esteem beyond the very words which brought her to life. More than anything, I simply wanted to hold her in my hand, pretending to be hers in every sense of the word. A lucky charm of eternity which

I could have stared at her for hours, absorbing the finer details of her skin. Hold her tight

The perfect image of cuckholdry

I could feel her body pressed against mine. The soft touch of her pores



So this is what love was. A pure evaporation if cynicism, .


. It was like staring at a godess.


She's distant.

### Waking up with Milo

 I was ecstatic.

The air was thin this morning. It had been quite cold recently, and I wasn't quite sure

"I think I have a condition."

"Fuck, you don't have syphilis, do you?", she spouted in an over-reaction of concern, hugging the bed-sheets in a last bastion of earthly safety.

"Oh no, it's not that.

"Try and talk about your mental il=ln

### Talk about making breakfast together.

"Wet cake makes for a soppy treat," she announces, floating her way to the heel of my toes, t-shirt draped across her bare shoulders.

### Breaking point.

(maybe make it about trust issues)

## Scene 2 START


### The breakup.

"I don't think I can do this anymore. I like you n' all, and I think you're a really smart and funny guy, but you're just not really my type."

My first reaction was to vomit. Either because I felt I deserved the pain of wretching my guts out, or because I felt so sick that I didn't know how else to respond.


 How does one feel rejection when they already live and breathe it by mere fracture of their existence?

"What do you mean? What more is there than being smart or funny?", I recited, following a long careful examination of the situation. Truth was, I was devastated.


### She leaves.

My first reaction once she'd left was to masturbate. It was remained in the sunken realisation that all hope had decided to evade me, leaving my corspe in a discoloured

It was what comforted me. Showed me peace. Helped soften the blow of having

Careful not to think, I picked myself up and slowly
I walked my
