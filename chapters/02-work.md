<!-- Work Introduction -->

In work we trust. A plutocratic orgy of totalitarian devastation, heiled as this week's perfect solution to the rampant "black" problem. Mornin' coffee. Mornin' wank. Mornin' bowl. The diabolical blood seeps from your gums and into your cereal, immaculately programming you into an insoluble undying commitment of useful, well-behaved utility. Margarine's tainted folly of hardened disappoint has it's heels firmly dug into your brain, as you attempt to pry the concrete from your eyes with a miniature-sized pickaxe at 5:20am in the morning. Shuckle up, bucko. It's time to cradle the flair.

"In work we trust," preaches an overly-caffeinated woman sitting on-top of a stack of repurposed milk crates, lactating in the veins firmly attached to the outer-rims of the patriarchy's network of incompatible. "It's all leverage, silly," she floats in a cheer of butchered anxiety, as she turns her attention towards her computer screen, avidly licking her lips at the touch of her mouse, eyes caught in a casual dally with a Kanban Board of Innovation featuring a list of all her best physical features. It's what kept her breasts inflated and her fake eyelashes in routine, gorged by a unidentifiable flurry of executive cock and caviar-littered cum, involving at least half the non-executive board and the CEO's Executive Assistance as well, trained in gymnastic all for good measure. "Take this poor women and guide her towards the top of patriarchy," gleams a over-worked office manager in an over-sized company sweater, gaff in choking fit of disaster following a sincere attempt to deep-throat a hard-drive full of high-resolution pictures of the CEO's junk. Unfortunately, it just ain't the same for ol' dick-weed here, what with his thick facial hair and inability to imitate a Disney-inspired blow-job, fortunately fit for his daughter who's proudly finishing her 3rd stint in rehab following an unfortunate incident with the exec.

to sound like a small girl.

Although I must admit, there's nothing quite like a carpal-tunnel inducing hand-job at 3 to 10 in the afternoon, following an hour-long lecture on the

Following this morning's disastrous ousting with the editor, I was truly in no mood to sort paper, snort wafer, nor entertain the upper soiree with my two-time tap-plastic beat. What I truly wanted was a gun and a live-animal to contest with, as an outlet to express my debilitating sorrow. The hostess would call me 'Big Akimbo' in honorary procession, as I held my delightful finger firm on the trigger of thy gun, repeatedly emptying an entire magazine of 5.56 mm hollow point rounds into the head of a docile four-legged creature. Preferably in front of it's own fawn, as I stand there in an uncompromising vision of success, against the hardened tyranny of moral expectation. It's shrapnel-imbued carcass will then to be held by it's hobble ears to be smooched by it's slobbering gob, intense with the fervour of an over-cooked bucket of ravioli slosh, as I grin awkwardly into the sun to be captured in photographic memory for future generations to inspire and relate. I was going to make it work.

<!-- Stuck outside -->

Ruffling through my coat I'd realised that I'd forgotten to bring my pass into work, as I stared quietly at the foreboding glass doors barring me from performing today's financial execution. My green-stitched coat now also reeking of the emulsified pork and chive from the oriental dive bar earlier, an event which has since spawned an all-out war between my mouth and my stomach. North vs South in a diluted battle of makeshift terms, fuzzy in the lack of genuine discourse being discussed amongst the various allies of tongue and cheek. Befuddled and stuck in the firm certainty of despair, I wasn't quite sure what to do, given it was past lunch time and I'd decided not to even bother showing up to work to begin with. Especially since I knew my boss was going to be away, if not out of chance, just like he'd been for most of my child and adult life. Maybe that explained my erratic behaviour and desperate attention-seeking prowess, the proud legacy of a lifetime of professional neglect and ineffective HR practices. Obviously, my options were limited to the pocket-sized grain of rationality that hadn't yet been completed consumed by the creeping anxiety of being fired in some dramatic shootout in the carpark, so I had to think fast.

Was it in my best interest to grab a conveniently-located bench and use it as a battering ram in a sheer act of publicity-fueled terrorism, in an ode to my humble loyalty towards Capitalism best-practice? Where were the freely-available messenger pigeons at this time of day, needlessly vain in their help and counselling in these dreary times of need? Maybe the reasonable thing to do was call my boss, and pretend as if I'd caught some sort of medieval disease which prevented me from understanding the core fundamentals of Excel. Ah, yes. A fine day's work is truly never over. A kind of dibble-dabble affair that conspires to dribble you in the nonsensical pleasure of well-organised crime, lesser to the pagan beliefs you uphold as gospel upon God's almighty vision. A mechanical duet featuring your absolute best face in an air-tight vacuum of outstanding perfection, mired upon a palette of plastic purple laminate, suitably moulded into tiny matchsticks for your mouth to align. "Half a matchstick each day keeps ol' Maggie away from caressing ye ol' heart monitor!", murmurs a fading voice in the back of my mind, somewhat delirious in the poorly-received intention gushing from my skull.

<!-- Meet Milo -->

"I'm guessing you forgot your pass again," approaches a pathless voice from the wide-open carpark fronting the technological fortress of torture machines and wires, fit with enough connective fibre to meet Ethiopia's anal porn needs. Judging by the snark prelude that emanated from her voice, there was no doubt in my mind it was Milo. The goddess of  whom littered my internet search history in an exploding file of mesmerising detail, I truly wanted nothing more than to grab her by the hair and fuck her senseless until the cataracts in my eyes bled green. It was too bad she knew nothing of my obsession, shrouded in the ripped veil of velvet rouge, only for my imagination to see. I dearly hoped she felt the same of me, although I knew it was wishful thinking.

"I guess I have indeed," as I stood there slightly enamoured with her presence. Well, it was more of an immediate obsession than it was a simple acknowledgement to be upheld. Those piercing Armenian eyes, wrapped thick in the shrill curls of a maniac-saviour. Ready to lure, attract and murder at an unintentional glance. Her body as slender and as elusive as the wisp of time itself, emancipated in a deformed stock of cigarette ash and compact opulence. It was everything I envisioned and more. I was sure there was an innate part of her brain that derived pleasure from drenching her lovers in coarse honey, before twisting them into all sorts of tautologically impossible shapes to be fucked and played with, or as she described, a short-stint in rehab. I'm sure my therapist wouldn't have been too happy with those thoughts.

<!-- Describe building + Interaction with the receptionist -->

Through the bright cellophane interiors of the refurbished lobby, fit with exotic Peruvian plants and a custom wood finish on the isolated desk ahead of me sat the receptionist. A messy ball of anxious wool and tangled cat hair, stunned in the bright pink, yellow and orange knitted jumpers she would wear all over her voluptuous body. She was a small personality trapped behind a big self-conscious smile, hidden beneath a desecrated tub of Neopolitan ice-cream she left under her bed, conveniently finished without even a trace of dairy to harm a lactose-intolerant child. Of course, I also wanted to fuck her too. Definitely worth paying to see a cam show, at the very least.

"Good morning!" I shout, trying my best to sound like an all-inclusive trip to Disney Land.

"Good morning? You know it's like, mid-afternoon, right?" Fuck. Just, fuck. I suppose it wasn't that bad. Maybe she found the aloofness attractive. My lovely self, that quirky asian wall-flower to be subtly admired with a nonchalant book on the intricate ironies of organic gardening. Perhaps it was an equivocal event to be pre-supposed by a romantic date on a sunset promenade, candle-lit in serene curiosity, followed by a weekend of average uninspired sex. Although I highly doubted my desirability as a man. No one wants to swipe right on the weird looking pervert licking his lips feverously at the sight of a bucket of chicken. I suppose I wasn't quite sure what it was girls wanted at all. Perhaps I didn't really care, because it conflicted what I wanted as a creep. A sick virtual fantasy of cum and gore, soiled all over the senses in a heap of used panties and unwashed lingerie, drenched in a cake of warm semen and indecent sweat. Mortal indecency sopping in the crimes of a sex-offender. Maybe that's what I should call my book.

"Oh right, I had no idea," I remarked with an unconvincing smirk and a jovial  two-thumbs up, now pacing myself to my desk in a blitzkrieg of dirty thoughts and deranged requirements. Kaleidoscopic in a tangerine muse of teak stripes and amusing spaces, the office opened itself up in a heightened display of fluorescent lights

<!-- Describe office + desk/work area -->

I never really knew what to expect, but something was always missing. Either I was an easy target to steal from, or the nightly cleaner seemingly hated absolute everything about my existence. Either way,

"Hey, did you hear about the updated deadlines? I swear, it changes daily," Milo remarked, dispassionate at the seams in a flurry of untied hair and a penchant

"I have no idea," I responded, intense in my desire to remove myself from her presence. I mean, it's not like I hated her or anything. Yet another a painful distraction from the thousands of clammy decisions grabbing at my brain and fuck me, but who am I not in love with these days? Yes, an enticingly offensive remark considering the integrity of these tight, syncratic lips. Beauty in their form and sour in their unreckoning desire to force grace into the tiny, dopamine-sized pockets preoccupying your brains. Pour the brandy into thy castle and deliver thy swine from the depths of hell. Oh, ever-so hellish indeed.

But I was born to win. To gather and disperse in complete declaration of the

Well, at least all of this would hold true if the dreaded excesses of work didn't also lead to an almost debilitating level of self-harm, now manifesting itself into a compulsive desire to gouge your own eyes out with the edge of a disposable plastic knife, left ever-so keenly on the kitchen table of the office 3rd floor. A symbol of 21st century martyr in thy duty of extreme stress, delegated ever-so softly as a personality disorder with just the right amount of sparkle n' jazz to keep the leadership in a-buzz.

It's a beautiful sight, as I gaze out into the foray of wild desks and fibre glass upholstry shimmering in the distance. You might even consider it a blessing of sorts, a weary collection of long-term aptitude, projecting itself across the the many faces of

Crinkle n' cut, Benny boy. It's time to solder those wounds shut and call it a day. I know that's exactly how our good friend Jesus would want it. Recuperated within the space of a 10 minute smoko which clearly got waaaayyy out of hand. Keep the change sucker. It's all on me.


"Well, it's a bit ridiculous, don't you think? Oh,  I'm going out for a fag, do you want one?"

"You know I don't smoke."

"I saw your drunk at last year's Christmas party buddy, flinging yourself around like a desperate chimney," as she walked out of the room and into the foyer, her petite silhouette causing all sorts of mischievous in my mind, as I followed her out in dire need of a cigarette. Women really are the worst.

"Ah, well, well, my child. It looks like the fatal grape has followed this hasty speed," passing me the pouch as she retrieved the filters from her purse.

I always found something sexual about casual smoking. Arguably I found everything

"So, how did le meeting with the editor go?"

"I really don't know, to be quite honest. He's a bit of a nut-job,


"Do you ever think about death."

<!-- Monologue #2 -->

Rhetoric aside, I actually quite like work. THANK YOU, EMPLOYEE #545. And aside from literally being paid by the hour to make this company-wide announcement, I genuinely think it's a perfect package of routine and marriage.

Milo returned with a coffee and a grin. Two things I've never seen her without.

I fingered through my manuscript.

"Hey, would you like to go on a date?"
