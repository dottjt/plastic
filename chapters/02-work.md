<!-- Work Introduction -->

In work we trust. A plutocratic orgy of totalitarian devastation, heiled as this week's perfect solution to the rampant "black" problem imprint to the segregation our society loves to weep. Mesmerisingly subterranean, it is the sensitive folly of an immaculate scheme designed to reprogram you into an insoluble undying commitment of useful, well-behaved utility. Shuckle up, bucko. It's time to cradle the flair.

Following this morning's disastrous ousting with the editor, I was truly in no mood to sort paper, snort wafer, nor entertain the upper soiree with my two-time tap-plastic beat. What I truly wanted was a gun and a live-animal to contest with. An outlet to express my debilitating sorrow with, by repeatedly emptying an entire magazine of 5.56 mm hollow point rounds into the head of a docile four-legged creature. Preferably in front of it's own fawn, as I stood there in an uncompromising vision of success, against the hardened tyranny of moral expectation. It's dead carcass will then to be held by it's ears and kissed by it's slobbering gob with the intense fervour of a bucket of over-cooked ravioli, as I grin awkwardly into the sun to be captured in photographic memory for future generations to inspire and relate. I was going to make it work.

"Fuck. I forgot to bring my pass." I realised to myself, as I stood near the foreboding glass doors barring me from entry. My coat reeking of the emulsified pork and chive I didn't even get a chance to eat. I mean, what he fuck. Should I grab an outside bench and use it as a battering ram to force myself in? Where are the freely-available messenger pigeons at this time of day, to offer help and guidance in these times of need? Maybe the reasonable thing to do was call my boss, and pretend as if I'd caught some sort of medieval disease which prevented me from understanding Excel ever again. Ah, yes. Work truly is the kind of dibble-dabble affair that dribbles you in the nonsensical pleasure of well-organised crime, lesser to the pagan beliefs you uphold as gospel upon God's almighty vision. A mechanical duet featuring your absolute best face in an air-tight vacuum of complete perfection, mired upon a palette of plastic purple laminate, suitably moulded into tiny matchsticks for your mouth to align. "Half a matchstick each day keeps ol' Maggie away from caressing the heart monitor!", murmurs the fading voice in the back of my mind, somewhat delirious in intention gushing from my skull.

At least all of this would hold true if the dreaded excess of work didn't also lead to an almost debilitating level of self-harm, now manifesting itself into a compulsive desire to gouge your own eyes out with the edge of a disposable plastic knife, left ever-so keenly on the kitchen table of the 3rd floor office. A symbol of 21st century martyr in thy duty of extreme stress, delegated ever-so softly as a personality disorder with just the right amount of sparkle n' jazz to keep the leadership in a-buzz.

"I'm guessing you forgot your pass again," approaches a pathless voice from the wide-open carpark of the contemporary compound, fit with enough connective fibre to meet Ethiopia's anal porn needs.

"I guess I have indeed," I respond, slightly enamoured with her presence. Truth is, I was more than enamoured. I was obsessed. Those piercing Armenian eyes, wrapped thick in the shrill curls of a maniac-saviour, ready to attract and judge at any moment. Her body as slender and as elusive as the wisp of time itself, emancipated in a deformed stock of compact opulence. I was sure there was an innate part of her that derived pleasure from drenching her lovers in coarse honey, before twisting them into all sorts of tautologically impossible shapes to be fucked and played with, on a bed in a short-stint in rehab. I'm sure my therapist wouldn't have been too happy with those thoughts.

"Hey, did you hear about the updated deadlines? I swear, it changes daily," Milo remarked, dispassionate at the seams in a flurry of untied hair and a penchant

"I have no idea," I responded, intense in my desire to remove myself from her presence. I mean, it's not like I hated her or anything. I just wanted nothing more than to grab her by the hair and fuck her senseless on the bathroom floors. Yet another a painful distraction from the thousands of clammy decisions grabbing at my brain and fuck me, but who am I not in love with these days? Yes, an enticingly offensive remark considering the integrity of these tight, syncratic lips. Beauty in their form and sour in their unreckoning desire to force grace into the tiny, dopamine-sized pockets preoccupying your brains. Pour the brandy into thy castle and deliver thy swine from the depths of hell. Oh, ever-so hellish indeed.



"Well, it's a bit ridiculous, don't you think. I'm going out for a fag, do you want one?"

"You know I don't smoke."

"I saw your drunk at last year's Christmas party buddy, flinging yourself around like a desperate chimney," as she walked out of the room and into the foyer, her petite silhouette causing all sorts of mischievous in my mind, as I followed her out in dire need of a cigarette. Women really are the worst.

"Ah, well, well, my child. It looks like the fatal grape has followed this hasty speed," passing me the pouch as she retrieved the filters from her purse.

Casual smoking.



"So, how did le meeting with the editor go?"

"I really don't know, to be quite honest. He's a bit of a nut-job,


"Do you ever think about death."

<!-- Monologue #2 -->

Rhetoric aside, I actually quite like work, and aside from literally being paid by the boat-load to make that outrageous statement, I genuinely think it's a perfect package of routine and marriage. A homeless mother which holds you dearly and maintains such reverence towards your new-found illness of being a cute millennial, that you really can't help but wonder how you deliberate any sort of significant meaning, beyond the corpse you just laid to rest with a blunt knife and a resolve to inflict meaningless revenge. It is a true sense of purpose to wake up at 5:20am in the morning, only to disappoint yourself later in an attempt to pry the concrete from your eyes using a miniature-sized pickaxe.

It's leverage, silly. That's what keeps your heart young and your fake eyelashes pretty. I mean, can you even taste the salt in the air? It's everywhere. In my eyes. My lungs, oh those poor little lungs of mine. It's a bit like trying to breathe without the glamour of knowing where exactly the oxygen is coming from. Perhaps that's just how we do it here in Cattle Country, remise to the steak you gorge on and hoard. An excellent place to adore, as well as ignore, all kinds of pertinent squalor; the same kind you so profess as professional gold. Your rough heart creates many.

"Take this poor women and guide her towards the top of patriarchy," gleams an overly-caffeinated man in a company sweater,


It's a beautiful sight, as I gaze out into the foray of wild desks and fibre glass upholstry shimmering in the distance. You might even consider it a blessing of sorts, a weary collection of long-term aptitude, projecting itself across the the many faces of

Crinkle n' cut, Benny boy. It's time to solder those wounds shut and call it a day. I know that's exactly how our good friend Jesus would want it. Recuperated within the space of a 10 minute smoko which clearly got waaaayyy out of hand. Keep the change sucker. It's all on me.


Milo returned with a coffee and a grin. Two things I've never seen her without.
