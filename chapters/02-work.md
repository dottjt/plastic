## Scene 1 START

### Work Introduction

In work we trust. A plutocratic orgy of totalitarian devastation. This week's solution to the rampant "black" problem. Mornin' coffee. Mornin' wank. Mornin' grain. Margarine's tainted folly of hardened bliss, as your fingers attempt to pry the vogue from your eyes with a pompadour pickaxe. The diabolical mud seeps from your gums and into the heart of your Special-K, programming your thumbs into an undying commitment of useful, well-behaved utility. Tizzle n' rawr. Shuckle up, bucko. It's time to cradle the flair.

### Touch Upon Editor Meeting

Following this morning's disastrous ousting with the editor, I was truly in no mood to sort paper, snort chaffer, nor entertain the upper soiree with my two-time tap-plastic beat. What I truly wanted was a gun and a live-animal to contest with. An outlet to express my debilitating sorrow, as I empty an entire magazine of 5.56 mm hollow point rounds into the mouth of a docile four-legged creature. Preferably in front of it's own fawn. The hostess would then announce me 'Big Akimbo' in honorary procession, as I stand there victorious in an uncompromising vision of success against the hardened tyranny of moral expectation. It's shrapnel-imbued carcass, to be chewed and held by it's hobble ears, compressed and violently ripped apart in a slobbering gob of ravioli slosh. The coursing blood from it's flimsy corpse, gushing and staining the white-righteous chastity of my teeth, as I grin awkwardly into the sun to be captured in photographic memorium for future generations to inspire. Truth was, I probably could have done with some lunch.

### Stuck Outside

I couldn't help but stare at the foreboding glass doors barring me from performing today's financial execution. The ruffle of my coat, reeking of the emulsified smells of pork and chive from the oriental dive bar earlier. My work pass misplaced, perhaps retrieved by a sultry Mr. Ming who had discovered something precious near our table, pawning it as an ancient barbaric relic from the outer-reaches of the West. Although truth be told, I never quite knew where my pass was at any given moment. It was in a constant state of flux. Laying dormant on my kitchen bench one moment, not a trace of it to be found the next. And yet it would always somehow reveal itself in the aftermath of the crisis, just when I no longer required it.

Dazed and confused in the acidic garging of my famished stomach, I had no choice other than to consult the pea-sized grain of rationality that hadn't yet been consumed by the creeping anxiety confiscating my abiilty to think. Was it in my best interest to force my way through the threshold in a sheer act of terrorism; an ode towards my fanatic devotion for all things Capitalistic? Where were the freely-available messenger pigeons at this time of day, needlessly vain in their help and counselling in these dreary times of need? Perhaps the reasonable thing to do was to call my boss, and pretend as if I'd caught some sort of medieval disease which prevented me from understanding the core fundamentals of software. Ah, yes. A fine day's work is never quite truly over, as we embrace the dibble-dabble affair that conspires to dribble us in the nonsensical pleasure of well-organised crime, lesser to the pagan beliefs you uphold as gospel upon God's almighty vision. A mechanical duet featuring your absolute best face in an air-tight vacuum of outstanding perfection, mired upon a palette of plastic purple laminate, suitably moulded into tiny matchsticks for your mouth to align. "Half a matchstick each day keeps ol' Maggie away from clutching ye ol' heart monitor!", murmurs a fading voice in the back of my mind, somewhat delirious in the poorly-received intention seeping from my skull.

### Milo Introduction

"I'm guessing you forgot your pass again," approaches a pathless voice from the wide-open carpark fronting the technological fortress of torture and caress. Judging by the snark prelude that emanated from the tainted wisp in her words, there was no doubt in my mind it was Milo. The goddess of whim. The principal subject of my internet search history. Licorice whore. I truly wanted nothing more than to grab her astringent curls and fuck her senseless on the crumbling asphalt below, until the cataracts in her eyes bled a fantastic green and her body whimpered into a pleasant glow.

"I guess I have indeed," quavered the anxious hubris of my mouth, as I stood there entirely enamoured with her presence. The thick drape of her body shrouded in the ripped veil of a velvet rouge dress, only for my imagination to see. Those piercing Armenian eyes. The luna compulsiveness of her shrill eyebrows. Ready to lure, attract and quander at any given moment. Her figure, as slender and as elusive as the strands of time itself, emancipated in a deformed stock of cigarette ash and compact opulence. It was everything my tongue envisioned, and more. A coarse bounty of decaying sexuality, involving her honey-drenched touch, wrapped in a fine silk lace, designed to twist and churn the senses into a debauchery of tautologically impossible shapes. She was a casual fuck at an underfunded rehab clinic, cum dripping thin in a shower of condemning misery. Another arduous topic to discuss with my therapist, who likely would have disapproved of the past 3 minutes 23 seconds of my existence. I mean, what does she even know about romance anyway?

What categorised Milo, aside from my ardent obsession with her existence, was that she was a bipolar baby. Goldilock's manic retardant. The world's saddest poker face. One minute she would be ecstatic, bouncing around the walls, offering your hand in marriage. Only to be found soon thereafter within the damp confines of a staircase cupboard, wrists slashed in a stain of mascara, violently quivering in a melancholic chamber of stricken grief. Perhaps I was attracted to the inifinite possibility of her character. The boundless anonymity of her malfunctioning brain. The clarity of her struggle. The sex in her veins. Certainly, my therapist insisted that it was unhealthy to romanticise mental illness, although I simply couldn't help myself, as I found my mind being continually dragged back into the safety of my own depravity. Like a never-ending tide of pacifying glue. Evidently, Milo appeared to be in a manic mood today, which is probably why she kissed me on the cheek as she disappeared into the dark corners of the office building, leaving me in an infatuated heave of quantum exhilaration. The fantasy was becoming dangerously real.

## Scene 2 START

### Describe Building

Through the bright cellophane interiors of the refurbished lobby and into the preliminary trust of the mind, laid what was known as the Machine of Profit™. A delectable prophecy which bore the deceased flesh of a prominent entrepeneur, ravaged and annihilated in a cautry of mangled copper and synthetic cortisol. It existed as the life and blood of the accord, which all employees were expected to memorise and hold to the highest regard. Through prayer and worship, the ancient artifact existed to provide purpose to it's subjects, communicating it's intent via the extensive network of viridian tubes which ran through the hollow walls swallowing it's employees, abrassive in their prodigal delegation. JUMP. NOW. DOWN. DOWN. DOWN. And in a swift hive-mind of unconcerning urgency, thousands of helpless bodies plunged from their desk-side windows and onto the carpark below, haplessly captivated in a cacophony of demonic screaming and inaudible plight. Apparently, it didn't care much for sentimentality.

### Describe Receptionist

At the other end of the lobby, calculated in an entwined ensemble of endless elevator-music, revealed an impressive assortment of exotic Pruvian vines, latching themselves in exquisite fashion to form the company's logo in vivid three-dimensional delight. And on an isolated desk ahead, behind a custom wood finish with ever a most graceful dash of slut, sat the receptionist. A messy ball of anxious wool and tangled cat-hair, perpetually stunned in the bright pink, yellow and orange knitted jumpers she would praise all over her voluptuous body. A small personality trapped behind an over-sized smile of self-conscious duress, hidden within the confines of a desecrated tub of Neopolitan ice-cream, kept underneath her bed and unsparingly finished without even a trace of dairy to harm even the most sensitive of lactose-intolerant cells. Of course, I also wanted to fuck her too, but it was a detail which would blur into every woman I would ever meet, both past and present. Except for my mother, whom I wanted to kill.

"Good morning!", I blast at her face in a burst of viagra, trying my best to sound like a paid all-inclusive trip to the Bahamas.

"You know that you already said good morning earlier, right?" Well, I suppose it wasn't as bad as it could have been. No shame in being the office's quirky Asian wall-flower. Aloof in my nonchalant intricacies and non-ironic love for turn-based RPGs. Perhaps my overarching awkwardness would eventually lead to a romantic date with thy lovely receptionist, on a man-made sunset promenade with a candle-lit dinner in serene curiosity, followed by a night of uninspiring sex involving a curved dildo and an intense fear of syphillis. Certainly, I didn't think of myself as something desirable, in the same way that I felt women were to be cherished and admired. Perhaps it was an extension of the self-hate that I felt for myself; the unfortunate paradox of being an Asian male in Western society. Too traumatised to fuck our own kind, yet too unaccepting of the watered-down pool of white women whom considered the use of chopsticks an advanced trickery of the mind. Perhaps I simply didn't care, what with my infinite virtual fantasy-land of cum and gore, soiled in a heap of used panties and underaged women in latex swimsuits. A delicate ruse which kept me from crying alone, almost none the time.

### Orange back, Blue back

"Oh right, I had no idea," remarked the pervert towards the receptionist, tattered in an unconvincing smirk of giddy insolence, as I licked my lips feverously at the sight of raw chicken. My two opposable thumbs, springing spastic from their sockets. Zig-zagging in a jovial haste of pittered discretion. Arguably, beginning a new chapter within our lives where we would never speak with each other again. A beautiful stroke of premonition, I thought to myself, as I brushed my way through the corduroy corridor of the aforementioned lobby and into the blubbered outline of the office kitchen. A primal 70s' decor filled to the brim with unwashed tupperware and #1 dad mugs. Complemented only by the sickly yellow synthesis, oozing from the congregation of fake Tulips situated to the north of the perimeter. Coalescing in satanic droves. Releasing their varnished smells into the decrepit pit of the grimy kitchen floor below. The office kitchen truly was an industrial institution intended to provide just enough grim to keep the magic of culinary creativity from harming the tastebuds of the old white executives haunting these halls, chewin' white bread n' slammin' vita-pills to meet their daily sustenance needs. "A hauty necessity of the uttermost importance", as was described in a recent board meeting of heart monitors and Eldridge naval ties.

I observe a man glass a co-worker with a kumbutcha bottle, senseless in a fit of rage. His swank body thrown against a malfunctioning vending machine. Beaten and raped. The aggressor proceeds to shank his victim's crippled body with a jigsaw grip, puncturing his vital organs in a quelch of splattered blood. His requisite arteries snapping in two. Delure. A heated interaction between the two predominant factions playing God within these walls. Culminating in thrice. Dripping morose, in an uncanny refuge upon the crimson surface of the office kitchen floor. According to the company accord, you were either an orange-back or a blue-back. A bottom-feeder or a cut-throat liar.

The orange-backs maintained the Machine of Profit™. Hardened loyalists with an obsessive personality, fanatic in their pursuit for operational perfection. They documented, studied and lauded over every single aspect of the Machine of Profit™ in an entire library full of arcane functions. Tested and praised for their striking simulation of reality. They existed as the ultimate servants to the establishment. An introverted cog of divine certification, vaticinal in their ability to optimise even the most basic of algorithms. Lead by a pale autistic child who bore tiny little keyboards for fingers, he went as far as to have his frail body fused into the Machine of Profit™ itself, dependent upon it's operation for his survival. He was widely known as the Son of Machine™.

The blue-backs on the other hand were the very source of the Machine of Profit™ itself. Privileged emissaries whom kept it's precious profits flowing in a ritual sacrifice known as the accordance. At the precise dot of every hour, two blue-backs would be chosen from the chantry by the High Priest of Profit™, to have their naked bodies fed into the machine and mashed into a viscous chenille collagen, stamped and compressed into company credits. Proliferating margin into an ever-growing stream of profit, second only to the machine's glowing aura of surfeit. A beautiful death in the eyes of the communion; the sole duty of the blue-back. To churn, and be churned, their cheer awash with the twady vigour which kept their faces in deep attention with the profit which made them whole.

Yet inspite their necessity as a whole, the blue-backs and the orange-backs despised each other with a hatred which divided the office into an obliteration of Odsidian passion. They each believed that they alone could bring greatness to the machine, hindered only by the actions of their opposing brethren. Like an adhesive of fire and ice, attempting to dislocate the oxygen sustaining it's very existence. Although perhaps it was by design. A competitive farce which extended all purpose beyond it's original conception, leaving the resplendence of the machine intact, while the world around it faded into an unlit conflict of tenebrous proportion. Ultimately, only the Machine of Profit™ knew.

Admittedly, I didn't really understand the whole she-bang. I barely even wanted to be here, let alone surround myself in the politics of old. I was merely a sloucher with a dip. A leech in the system to be powdered in caesin and stashed away come tax time. Neither useful, nor indispensible. A self-sustaining pile of inconsistent trouble, enough to make my existence seem worthwhile, yet not radically out-of-order enough to appear disruptive. Another drifter with a shoe for a sock, cause the paper ain't gonna push itself, sweetie.

### Describe Desk

In the fluorscent blindness of the tangled overhead lights above, the refraction of the sun beamed it's warm hues onto the cluttered mess preoccupying my desk. A welcome touch to the hundreds of unanswered emails lurking within my mailbox, sizzling in the heavenly bask of the great big ball in the sky, deciding night and day without even a quandry of discord. Warmth was a considerable commodity in this office, forever displaced by the orange-back's desire to be thawed into a flawless image of cognitive certainty, in conflict with the blue-back's inherent misandry for molten cleansing. Pushing aside a folder of printed pamphlets, I sat patiently in my chair, staring at the clock on my computer screen, just about ready to get right back up and head home.

### Milo Conversation

"Hey, did you hear about the updated deadlines? I swear, it changes daily," Milo remarked, dispassionate at the seams in an untied flurry of sex hair and dorky conversation.

"I have no idea," I respond, intense in my desire to remove myself from her presence. As much as I wanted to shove my hands into the seam of her dress, as I suckled her perched nipples with the length of my tongue, it was yet another painful distraction from the thousands of clammy decisions grappling with my brain, leaving me in a superflous state of ceaseless employment. Handling itself inside the dopamine-sized pockets bursting with elation inside my head. Sour with lament. Pour the brandy onto thy castle and deliver thy swine from thy depths of swell. Oh, ever-so swellish indeed. I was man born to win. To gather and disperse in complete declaration of the intent which I commanded like Turkish hellfire from the wrathe of the Dardanelles.

Well, at least a fraction of this would hold true if the dreaded excess of work didn't also lead to an almost debilitating level of self-harm, now manifesting itself into a compulsive desire to gouge your own bladder out with a disposable plastic spoon, left ever-so keenly in the office kitchen for such prying eyes to declare. A symbol of millenial martyr in thy duty of unreasonable stress, delegated ever-so softly as a personality disorder with just the right amount of sparkle n' jazz to keep the leadership in a-buzz. Crinkle n' cut, slader. It's time to anneal those wounds n' call it a day. I gaze out into the foray of wild desks, admiring the fibre glass upholstry shimmering in the distance. I was sad to be alive.

### Milo Cigarette Invitation

"Well, it's a bit ridiculous, don't ya think? Anyway, I'm going out for a fag. Could I tempt you to join me?"

"You know I don't smoke."

"I saw you drunk at last year's Christmas party, Peter Pan. Slingin' yourself around like a desperate chimney. I have eyes, Mister," she accused in a playful taunt of crass notoriety, dangling a rolled cigarette in an alluring transgression of heist, sully from the tip of her fingers. Toes in motion, she pranced out of the room and into the foyer, exercising her petite silhouette through the light ethereal fabric adopting her skin, causing all sorts of devious mischievous within my mind. Well, I only knew all this because I decided to follow her out into the lobby, out of my designated slaughter pen and into her colloquial embrace, in dire need of a light and a cigarette. Women really were the worst, and I think she knew it herself. At the very least, it'd help kill some time.

## Scene 3 START

###  Describe Smoking

Below the stark corridors of the cubular profit centre above, bore the 20th century imprint of the methylated industrialisation which had ravished the construction workers of youth. An underground carpark the size of a 60,000 seat stadium, empty in it's glorious presentation. That was, empty aside from an old 1956 Holden Station Wagon which had been kept in immaculate condition since it's inception. A subject the orange-backs aggrieved in hoards, as they sat there in their muted orange suits, huddled in a sanctimonious profess of technical agility, licking discarded batteries by the bucket-full, afloat in an electrical buzz of drained competence. Eager to strike at any moment in a queer outburst of pan-fried lubricant. We skirted around the feint seethe of their activity, sure not to disturb their unrest, as we made our way to our designated spot next to the company ashtray. Oh, how you would love to learn about the company ashtray.

"Ah, well, well. My sunken child. Ol' Ditto. It looks like the fatal grape has followed this hasty seed." She passed me her pouch of tobacco, le port royale, fit with an assortment of crinkled papers and circumcised filters. Excited in the presentment that I, her fatal grape, were to smoke tobacco with papers that she personally touched. Allowing me to inhale her essence in my every breath, and incorporate her linger into the depths of my soul. The perfect excuse to inhale, if ever there were one. Inherently, I always found something sexual about smoking. No different to masturbating or crying, in a casual degrade which suffered no explanation. A modern suicide pact for today's young people to enjoy. Poorly-rolled and in full contempt of my fingers, I took a long drag of my cigarette, placing my calm besides me. Loosening my lips with an emerging enthusiasm. Pittering in the ensuing cough.

### Discuss meeting with editor

"So, how did the meeting with the editor go? Same cunt as the last one?", she remarked, as she took a long squinted drag of her enlongated cigarette.

"Pretty much. He was a bit of a nut-job."

"Hey, at least you didn't have to blow him. Unless if you did, then I totally understand why it went sour."

"Listen. It's hard delivering half-chewed cock in the back of a Chinese restaurant, especially when your mouth is covered in tom-yum sauce." She giggled. I loved it she giggled.

"At the very least you're passionate about something. I can barely decide on what toast or cereal for breakfast. I think you have something special."

"Ah well, you know how it is. Churn in, churn out."

I wasn't sure if love quite described how I felt about Milo, but there was something fun and magical which would coarse through my body each and every time I spoke with her, trickled by an uncontrollable surge of attraction, forcing my eyes to glisten in a glee of transparent sincerity. Our hilarious banter. The way she would punch my arm whenever I would comment on her silly hair. Maybe it was because she was the only female I spent more than 30 minutes with each day. That for sure, was certain. Yet perhaps we had something more. Something tangible which could be spelled out with words. For a few seconds we both stood there, staring the ground in reflection, admiring the silence of each other's obscurity. Keenly unaware of each other's feelings. And yet although the peaceful composure of my cigarette put me at ease, nothing could have prepared me for what would happen next.

### Flirt/Proposal

"Do you ever think about death?", she asked, catching me by surprise.

"Not really. Probably no more than most people. Why?"

"Like, let's say we were trapped down here and we only had five minutes to live before the building collapsed and crushed us. What would you do?" Her question made me anxious. Like having needles forced through my liver, in an exercise of pre-marital self-care. Obviously, I would fuck her. But if it were that easy then I probably wouldn't have any self-esteem issues. She approached me slowly and dipped her finger into her mouth, ditzy in a gesture of blue. She was all in.

"I'd probably, uh..."

"Would you fuck me?", she unveiled, licking the outline of her lips with her dry tongue, gazing her eyes deeply into mine, as if to suggest we were one. Vulnerable in her childish voice, whispering her words with an intricate frown, as she approached closer and closer towards me, before eventually holding her hand out to the tip of my chin.

"...and hold me, and tell me that everything was going to be okay as you rammed my tight little pussy with your giant cock?" I bit my lip.

"Yeah. Probably that." My heart pounded into a schizophrenic drumbeat of restlessness. What had just happened? Was this real? Was this finally happening? In a sense, it felt like we'd both been feeling these things for a while, although in reality, it felt more like being eaten alive by a Lion. My arms limp from the impact-trauma of smashing my head against a rock, as it's large teeth tore through my legs, snapping bone n' blood into a sludge of stomach acid. I was both afraid and excited, with a dash of confusion to spread drama throughout my entire central nervous system.

"Then take me out this Friday night. Will you do that for me?", she gasped, before returning to her former self. Wise and unruffled in an equanimous stance.

"Yeah, sure. I can do that. I would love to do that. Do you have my number?"

### Elevator ride back

We chatted casually about key deliverables on the elevator ride back up to the kitchen, subtly shaken by the events prior. I still didn't quite know what to think of what I just experienced. It felt in part as if I'd died and gone to heaven, yet it was an event which also filled me with anxiety. Was it even real? I couldn't help but feel that something traumatic had happened, even though it invigorated me beyond all words. Yes. This was a good thing and I was finally going to fuck her in reality, as opposed to in my sex dreams. The one thing which I'd never actually considered. Maybe that's what made me afraid, not matching up to those lofty expectations I'd set in stone. I didn't want to delve on it any longer. I just wanted another cigarette.

The kaleidoscopic walls of the office building blended itself into a tangerine muse of teak stripes and amusing spaces, as I sludged my way back to our office area. Milo decided to pick up a coffee and a grin in the kitchen, her two modern staples which kept her regular. She stood there with her legs crossed, passing me a smile at me as we both waited for her coffe to brew. Hoping she wasn't secretly crumbling inside, ready to run outside and into on-coming traffic.

And then there was tonight's arrangement. Another interpersonal hurdle to overcome in this delorian urchin of lavish joy. Hoot. Hoot. Ho.

## Scene 3 END
