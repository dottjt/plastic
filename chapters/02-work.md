## Scene 1 START - Milo

### Work Introduction

In work we trust. A plutocratic orgy of totalitarian devastation. The week's solution to the rampant "black" problem. Mornin' coffee. Mornin' grain. Mornin' wank. Margarine's tainted folly of hardened bliss, as you attempt to pry the vogue from your eyes with a pompadour pickaxe at 5:20am in the moonlight. Diabolical in the mud which seeps from your gums n' fizzles into the heart of your Special-K, programming Lucifer's spurious twiddle into an undying commitment of well-behaved utility. Shuckle up, bucko. It's time to cradle the flair.

### Touch Upon Editor Meeting

Following this morning's disastrous ousting with the editor, I was truly in no mood to sort paper, snort chaffer, nor entertain the upper soiree with my two-time tap-plastic beat. What I truly wanted was a gun and a live-animal to contest with; an outlet to express my debilitating sorrow, as I empty an entire magazine of 5.56 mm hollow point rounds into the mouth of a docile creature. Preferably, in front of its own fawn.

"Fuckin' Alakazam!" The hostess would then announce me Big Akimbo™ in honorary procession, as I stand there victorious in an uncompromising vision of success against the hardened tyranny of moral expectation. Its shrapnel-imbued carcass, to be chewed and held by its hobble ears, and then compressed and violently ripped apart in a slobbering gob of ravioli slosh. The coursing blood from its flimsy corpse, gushing and staining the taffy white-righteous chastity of my teeth. As I awkwardly grin into the sun to be captured in photographic memorium for future generations to inspire.

### Stuck Outside

Standing outside the office, I couldn't help but stare at the foreboding glass doors barring me from performing today's financial execution. With my work pass misplaced, I had no choice other than to remain completely oblivious to the emulsified stench of pork and chive which emanated from the erratic ruffle of my coat to the dismay of the staff adjacent, also loitering the car park for the very same reasons of casualty. Perhaps it'd fallen into the hands of a sultry Mr. Ming, pawning it as a barbaric relic of Western civilisation in hopes of banishing the outer-reaches of thy round-eyed vermin. Although truth be told, I never quite knew where my pass was in any given moment. It was as if it were in a constant state of flux. Lying dormant on my kitchen bench one moment, not a trace of it to be found the next. And yet, in spite of the odds, it would always somehow reveal itself in the aftermath of the crisis, just when it was no longer required.

Dazed and confused in the acidic gargle of my famished wren, I had no choice other than to consult the pea-sized grain of rationality subsiding within the disjointed hernia I recognised as my brain; that golden nugget of buxom ghee, lest consumed by the creeping anxiety of truancy now confiscating my ability to think. Was it in my best interest to force my way through the front doors in a sheer act of terrorism; an ode towards my fanatic devotion for hardline Capitalist production? Where were the freely-available messenger pigeons at this time of day, needlessly vain in their help of statement during these dreary times of counsel? Perhaps the reasonable thing to do was to call my boss, and pretend as if I'd caught some sort of medieval disease which prevented me from understanding the core fundamentals of Excel. Ah, yes. A fine day's work is never quite truly over, as we collectively embrace the dibble-dabble affair that conspires to dribble us in the nonsensical pleasure of well-organised crime, lesser to the pagan beliefs you uphold as gospel upon God's almighty vision of care. Featuring your absolute best face in a mechanical duet of outstanding perfection, mired upon a palette of plastic purple laminate in an air-tight vacuum of ever-lasting beauty, to be suitably moulded into tiny matchsticks for your cunning mouth to align. "Half a matchstick a day keeps ol' Maggie Jane away from clootching ye ol' heart monitor!", murmurs a fading voice in the back of my mind, somewhat delirious in the poorly-received intention seeping from my skull.

### Milo Introduction

"I'm guessing you forgot your pass again," approaches a pathless voice from the wide-open carpark fronting the technological fortress of torture and caress. Judging by the snark prelude that emanated from the tainted wisp within her words, there was no doubt in my mind it was Milo; the principal subject of my internet search history. Our goddess of whim. And although I stood there with the face of a rock, I truly wanted nothing more than to grab her astringent curls and fuck her senseless upon the rough surface of the crumbling asphalt below, until the cataracts in her eyes bled a fantastic green and her body whimpered into a pleasant glow of rainforest meets seaside.

"I guess I have indeed," quavered the anxious approximation of my mouth, as I stood there entirely enamoured with her presence. The thick drape of her body. The luna fascination of her shrill twirls. Tribute to the pierce duplicitous nature of her Armenian eyes, ready to lure, attract and quander at any given moment. Just as my heart desired. Her figure was as slender and as elusive as the strands of time itself, emancipated in a deformed stock of cigarette ash and compact opulence; shroud within the ripped veil of a velvet rouge dress, only for my imagination to see. She was everything my mind envisioned, and impossibly more. A treat of magnificience upon a coarse bounty of decaying sexuality, deliberating sin amongst a honey-drenched touch of fine silk lace; designed to twist and churn the senses into a debauchery of tautologically impossible shapes, and unforgiving sentences. She was everyone's casual fuck at an under-funded rehab clinic; cum dripping thin within a shower of condemning misery, as she scraped her bare body with the teal coral sponge her rapist had once forced upon her. Another arduous topic to discuss with my therapist, who most certainly would have disapproved of the past 3 minutes 23 seconds of my verbal existence. I mean, what would a lemon-suckling boomer even know about romance anyway, aside from the toilsome effects of Earl Grey tea on the libido following sunrise?

Certainly, my therapist insisted that it was unhealthy to romanticise mental illness, although I simply couldn't help but explore the unfetted depths of my enthralled mind, as I dragged myself back into the safety of my own depravity. Mesmerised within the vogue which kept my smile unhinged, and my foxtrot at ease. Perhaps I was attracted to the infinite possibility of her character; the insatiable anonymity of her malfunctioning wire, spilling its charge onto my soul in a nimble display of vile charity. Like a never-ending tide of pacifying glue, stitching my perception with the cognitive duress of a trussed pig. One minute she would be astonished in a raptuous ecstasy of envious merriment, only to be found soon thereafter, locked within the damp confines of a staircase cupboard; wrists slashed nine upon a transdermal infusion of cheap mascara and yearning debt, quivering violent to the melancholic chamber of Johnnie Walker's stricken grief. Evidently, my indignant marquess of fractured leisure appeared to be in a manic today, which is probably why she'd inadvertently decided to kiss me on the cheek before flouncing into the lobby, and disappearing entirely into the sunken infamy that was daily work life. Leaving my body to the infatuated heave of my own quantum exhilaration; boundlessly afraid of what my mind could do with only a fraction of her attention. The fantasy I'd adored was becoming dangerously real, and I knew not how to handle the gorge in my relent.

## Scene 2 START

### Describe Building

Through the bright cellophane interiors of the refurbished lobby and into the preliminary trust of the mind, laid what was known as the Machine of Profit™. A delectable prophecy which bore the deceased flesh of a prominent entrepreneur, ravaged and annihilated in a cautry blunder of mangled copper and synthetic cortisol. It existed as the life and blood of the Accord™, which all employees were expected to memorise and hold in the highest regard. Through prayer and worship, the ancient artifact existed to provide purpose to its subjects, communicating its intent via the extensive network of viridian tubes which ran through the hollow walls of the building. Unapologetically abrasive in its prodigal delegation. JUMP. NOW. DOWN. DOWN. DOWN. And in a swift hive-mind of unconcerning urgency, thousands of helpless bodies plunged from their desk-side windows and onto the carpark below, haplessly captivated in a cacophony of demonic screaming and inaudible plight. Apparently, it thought little of the very humans it consigned.

### Describe Receptionist

Then at the end of the lobby, calculated in an entwined ensemble of endless elevator-music from the extracted bellows of the beast below, revealed an impressive assortment of exotic Peruvian vines, latching themselves exquisite to form the company's logo in vivid three-dimensional form. And on an isolated desk ahead, behind a custom taupe fringe of illegally-sourced rosewood, unveiled the implicate declaration of the receptionist. A messy ball of anxious wool and tangled cat-hair, perpetually stunned in the bright pink, yellow and orange knitted jumpers she praised all over her voluptuous body. She was a small personality trapped behind the over-sized smile of a frenzied coroner, equipped with the false bravado of a self-conscious fire-breathing igloo. It was an uncomfortable trait she disguised within the empty confines of the desecrated tubs of ice-cream littered inconspicuous under the humiliation of her vestal bed, without even a trace of dairy to harm even the most sensitive of lactose-intolerant cells, in what appeared to be a nightly ritual of unconsecrated decimation. Thankfully, I also wanted to fuck her too. As I stood there with my inconsummate hands, keen to grab at the unholy sight of her angel wings, thunderously protruding from the plump crest of her uncasual figure. Biting into what I'll now describe as an inch-thick layer of cum-inducing cellulite; tartare in the scream of a repressed whore, with an ever most graceful dash of slut to louse. Although it was also a course of action which would blur into almost every woman I would ever encounter, with the exception of my mother whom I largely wanted to kill.

"Good morning!", I blast at her face. Burst in a tangent of Viagra, as I tried my best to sound like an all-inclusive trip to the Bahamas.

"You know it's not morning, right?" Well, I suppose it wasn't as bad as it could have been. No shame in being the quirky Asian wall-flower, aloof in my nonchalant intricacies and non-ironic love for turn-based RPGs. Perhaps my insistent awkwardness would eventually lead to a romantic soirée with thy lovely receptionist, involving a police-cautioned night of uninspired sex and late-night television. Certainly, I didn't think of myself as something to be desired, nor denied. Perhaps it was an extension of the self-hate that I felt for my own life as part of the unfortunate paradox of the Westernised Asian Male. Too traumatised to fuck its own kind, yet too unaccepting of the watered-down pool of white women whom brushed us like a torn garment at a flea-sale. Although perhaps I simply didn't care, what with my infinite virtual fantasy-land of cum and gore which promised to shower me in a soiled heap of used panties and latex swimsuits whenever I pleased; a delicate ruse which kept me from crying alone, almost none the time.

### Orange back, Blue back

"Oh right," remarked the avid pervert towards thy indecently pallid receptionist; tattered in an unconvincing smirk of giddy insolence, as I licked my lips feverously at the sight of raw chicken. Witness to my two opposable thumbs, now springing spastic from their sockets in a jovial haste of pittered discretion. Arguably, beginning a new chapter within our lives, where we would absolutely never speak to each other again. How lovely, I thought to myself, as I brushed my way through the corduroy corridor of the aforementioned lobby and into the vulgar outline of the office kitchen.

The beloved kitchen was a primal 70s' decor filled to the brim with unwashed tupperware and #1 dad mugs, complemented only by the sickly yellow synthesis oozing from the congregation of fake Tulips situated to the north of the perimeter. As the polychlorinated flowers released their varnished smells into the decrepit pit of the grimy kitchen floor below, second only to the potent mustard gas fumes which plumed from the stale epoxy seal of the open fridge door. A truly terrifying combination for both human and rodent alike, as the surrounding contamination continued to coalesce under the satanic weight of its own agony.

Ultimately, the indoor kitchen was little more than an industrial institution, intended to provide just enough grim to prevent the magic of creativity from harming the pulchritudinous tastebuds of the old white executives these halls had haunted for far too long. "Chewin' white bread n' slammin' vita-pills. A haughty necessity of the uttermost importance, " as was described in a recent board meeting of heart monitors and Eldridge naval ties. It seemed that the casualty of youth was upon us.

Although midday had seemingly sauntered into its post-lunch lull, the tension within the room had become seemingly joust. A push. A jostle. Then in a senseless fit of rage, I observe a man glass a co-worker with a bottle of kombucha; his swank body thrown against the flickering malfunction of a faulty snack machine, only to be choked with the remaining shards of scoby-infused glass being forced down his throat with a fist n' a pull. The aggressor then proceeds to shank his victim's flailing corpse with the vice of a jigsaw grip, puncturing his vital organs in a quelch of splattered blood. His requisite arteries, now snapped in two. Culminating in thrice. Delure. Terrified from the resulting mayhem, it became clear that what I'd just witnessed was in fact a heated interaction between the two predominant factions playing God within these walls. Dripping morose upon an uncanny refuge of crimson polish, now splayed against the carpet for which there was no prayer. According to the Accord™, you were either an orange-back or a blue-back. A bottom-feeder or a cut-throat liar. I suppose I'll attempt to explain the rest.

The orange-backs maintained the Machine of Profit™. They were hardened loyalists with an obsessive personality; fanatic in their pursuit for operational perfection. Precise in both name and practice, they decisively documented, studied and lauded over every single aspect of the Machine of Profit™. Understood to be thrifty scavengers with a gifted sense of time, they could survive for weeks on end with but the tepid moisture of their commitment to the grind. An introverted cog of divine certification and befuddled self-esteem, the orange-backs were considered the ultimate servants to the establishment; vaticinal in their ability to optimise even the most complex of algorithms. Lead by a pale autistic child whom bore tiny keyboards for fingers, the Son of Machine™ went as far as to have his frail body fused into the Machine of Profit™ itself, in order the become truly dependent upon it's operation for his survival.

The blue-backs on the other hand were the very source of the Machine of Profit™ itself; privileged emissaries whom kept its precious profits flowing in a ritual sacrifice known as the Accordance™. Knighted the Carriers of Profit™ in both title and religion, two blue-backs were to be chosen from the chantry by the High Priest of Profit™ at the precise dawn of every hour, to have their naked bodies fed into the scorching furnace of the machine. As their toes and limbs were mashed and bled into a chenille collagen of viscous halcyon, to be stamped and compressed into the company credits its subjects accepted as gospel; carelessly proliferating margin into the ever-growing stream of company profit, second only to the machine's ever glowing aura of revenue and surfeit. Their sacrifice was seen as a beautiful death in the eyes of the communion, as well as their sole responsibility in the grand scheme of surplus; their cheer awash with the twady vigour which kept their faces in deep attention with the profit which made them whole.

Yet in spite of their integral necessity as a whole, both the blue-backs and the orange-backs despised each other with a passion which divided the office into a celebration of denigrated hatred. They alone believed that only they could bring greatness to the machine; hindered only by the actions of their opposing brethren. Much like an unruly adhesive of fire and ice, attempting to dislocate the very oxygen sustaining its complex existence. Although, perhaps the cancellation was by design; a competitive farce which extended all purpose beyond its original conception, allowing the machine to remain intact within the resplendence of its perceived glory, while the world around it faded into an unlit conflict of tenebrous veneration. Only the Machine of Profit™ knew.

Admittedly, I thought the whole thing was a bit of a farce. Why anyone would ever concern themselves with the politics of Christ was well-beyond my intuition for even showing up to work at all. With the divine authority vested in me, all I truly wanted was to retain my position as a primordial sloucher beneath the anachronistic wings of bureaucracy; a leech upon the system to be powdered in casein and stashed away come tax time. Neither useful, nor indispensable. A mere conscious reminder of the limitless potential my seniors ever-so desperately sought; though not quite so radically proven beyond the sarcasm which flowed from my words and in around the hermeneutic hum of the cheerless water cooler. Not that anyone could be bothered counting the somewhat missing pieces of paper I never intended to push. That would require a level of transparency nominally above the far-reaching incompetency of middle-management.

### Describe Desk

Truculently caught in the fluorescent blindness of the ceiling lights above, I squandered my step towards the refraction of the sun as it beamed its warm hues onto the cluttered mess of my desk; a welcome touch upon the hundreds of unanswered emails lurking grovel within my mailbox. Truth be told that warmth was a considerable commodity in this office. Forever displaced by the orange-back's desire to be thawed into a flawless image of its own cognitive certainty, in conflict with the blue-back's inherent misandry for molten absolution. Pushing aside a folder of printed pamphlets into the bin beside my desk, I sat patiently in the coveted arch of my chair; staring blankly at the miniaturised clock in the bottom right-hand corner of my computer screen. Just about ready to get right back up n' head home for the day.

### Milo Conversation

"Hey, did you hear about the updated deadlines? I swear, they change daily," remarked Milo. Dispassionate at the seams in an untied flurry of sex-hair and dorky conversation.

"I have no idea," I respond. Intense in my desire to remove myself from the magnet of her presence. As much as I wanted to shove my hands into the seams of her lovely dress and invent a new kind of dignity, she was yet another painful distraction from the thousands of clammy decisions grappling with my brain; somewhat leaving me in a superfluous state of ceaseless 9-to-5 employment. Sour with lament. The delegation had broke. Pour the brandy onto thy holy castle and deliver thy swine from thy depths of swell. Oh, ever-so swellish indeed. I was man born to win; to gather n' disperse in complete declaration of the resent which I commanded like a Turkish hellfire from the wrath of the Dardanelles.
-->

As I sat there loathing in the dreaded excess of work, leaving me no choice but to pursue an almost debilitating level of self-harm; now manifesting itself into a compulsive desire to gouge my own bladder out with a disposable plastic spoon, left ever-so keenly in the office kitchen for such prying eyes to bleed. Perhaps I would become a symbol of millennial martyr in thy duty of unreasonable stress, delegated ever-so softly as a desirable personality trait for thy recruiters to amend. Providing just the right amount of sparkle n' jazz to keep thy leadership in a-buzz, and thy mental health budget in arrears. Crinkle n' cut, slader. As I gaze out into the foray of empty desks before me, admiring the fibre glass upholstery of their shimmering anneal. It was a sad time to be alive, let alone in this office of purgatory.

### Milo Cigarette Invitation

"Well, it's plain fucked if you ask me. I'm going out for a fag. Could I perhaps ...tempt you to join me?"

"You know I don't smoke."

"We all saw you drunk at last year's Christmas party, Peter Pan. Slingin' yourself round' like a desperate chimney. We have eyes, you know." I loved the way Milo taunted me, as she dangling a rolled cigarette in front of my eyes, sully in an alluring transgression of heist from the tip of her exquisite fingers. Toes in motion; prancing out of the room and into the foyer. Exercising her petite silhouette through the ethereal fabric adopting her skin,

 causing all sorts of devious mischievous within my mind. Well, I only knew all this because I decided to follow her out into the lobby, out of my designated slaughter pen and into her colloquial embrace, in dire need of a light and a cigarette. Women really were the worst, and I think she knew it herself. At the very least, it'd help kill some time.

## Scene 3 START

###  Describe Smoking

Below the stark corridors of the cubular profit centre above, bore the 20th-century imprint of the methylated industrialisation which had ravished the construction workers of youth. An underground carpark the size of a 60,000 seat stadium, empty in its glorious presentation. That was, empty aside from an old 1956 Holden Station Wagon which had been kept in immaculate condition since its inception. A subject the orange-backs aggrieved in hoards, as they sat there in their muted orange suits, huddled in a sanctimonious profess of technical agility, licking discarded batteries by the bucket-full, afloat in an electrical buzz of drained competence. Eager to strike at any moment in a queer outburst of pan-fried lubricant. We skirted around the faint seethe of their activity, sure not to disturb their unrest, as we made our way to our designated spot next to the company ashtray. Oh, how you would love to learn about the company ashtray.

"Ah, well, well. My sunken child. Ol' Ditto. It looks like the fatal grape has followed this hasty seed." She passed me her pouch of tobacco, le port royale, fit with an assortment of crinkled papers and circumcised filters. Excited in the presentment that I, her fatal grape, were to smoke tobacco with papers that she personally touched. Allowing me to inhale her essence in my every breath, and incorporate her linger into the depths of my soul. The perfect excuse to inhale, if ever there were one. Inherently, I always found something sexual about smoking. No different to masturbating or crying, in a casual degrade which suffered no explanation. A modern suicide pact for today's young people to enjoy. Poorly-rolled and in full contempt of my fingers, I took a long drag of my cigarette, placing my calm besides me. Loosening my lips with an emerging enthusiasm. Pittering in the ensuing cough.

### Discuss meeting with editor

"So, how did the meeting with the editor go? Same cunt as the last one?", she remarked, as she took a long squinted drag of her elongated cigarette.

"Pretty much. He was a bit of a nut-job."

"Hey, at least you didn't have to blow him. Unless if you did, then I totally understand why it went sour."

"Listen. It's hard delivering half-chewed cock in the back of a Chinese restaurant, especially when your mouth is covered in tom-yum sauce." She giggled. I loved it she giggled.

"At the very least you're passionate about something. I can barely decide on what toast or cereal for breakfast. I think you have something special."

"Ah well, you know how it is. Churn in, churn out."

I wasn't sure if love quite described how I felt about Milo, but there was something fun and magical which would coarse through my body each and every time I spoke with her, trickled by an uncontrollable surge of attraction, forcing my eyes to glisten in a glee of transparent sincerity. Our hilarious banter. The way she would punch my arm whenever I would comment on her silly hair. Maybe it was because she was the only female I spent more than 30 minutes with each day. That for sure, was certain. Yet perhaps we had something more. Something tangible which could be spelled out with words. For a few seconds we both stood there, staring the ground in reflection, admiring the silence of each other's obscurity. Keenly unaware of each other's feelings. And yet although the peaceful composure of my cigarette put me at ease, nothing could have prepared me for what would happen next.

### Flirt/Proposal

"Do you ever think about death?", she asked, catching me by surprise.

"Not really. Probably no more than most people. Why?"

"Like, let's say we were trapped down here and we only had five minutes to live before the building collapsed and crushed us. What would you do?" Her question made me anxious. Like having needles forced through my liver, in an exercise of pre-marital self-care. Obviously, I would fuck her. But if it were that easy then I probably wouldn't have any self-esteem issues. She approached me slowly and dipped her finger into her mouth, ditzy in a gesture of blue. She was all in.

"I'd probably, uh..."

"Would you fuck me?", she unveiled, licking the outline of her lips with her dry tongue, gazing her eyes deeply into mine, as if to suggest we were one. Vulnerable in her childish voice, whispering her words with an intricate frown, as she approached closer and closer towards me, before eventually holding her hand out to the tip of my chin.

"...and hold me, and tell me that everything was going to be okay as you rammed my tight little pussy with your giant cock?" I bit my lip.

"Yeah. Probably that." My heart pounded into a schizophrenic drumbeat of restlessness. What had just happened? Was this real? Was this finally happening? In a sense, it felt like we'd both been feeling these things for a while, although in reality, it felt more like being eaten alive by a Lion. My arms limp from the impact-trauma of smashing my head against a rock, as its large teeth tore through my legs, snapping bone n' blood into a sludge of stomach acid. I was both afraid and excited, with a dash of confusion to spread drama throughout my entire central nervous system. Largely, I wasn't even sure if she was being serious.

"Then take me out this Sunday. Will you do that for me?", she gasped, before returning to her former self. Wise and unruffled in an equanimous stance.

"Yeah, sure. I can do that. I would love to do that. Do you have my number?"

### Elevator ride back

We chatted casually about key deliverables on the elevator ride back up to the kitchen, subtly shaken by the events prior. I still didn't quite know what to think of what I just experienced. It felt in part as if I'd died and gone to heaven, yet it was an event which also filled me with anxiety. Was it even real? I couldn't help but feel that something traumatic had happened, even though it invigorated me beyond all words. Yes. This was a good thing and I was finally going to fuck her in reality, as opposed to in my sex dreams. The one thing which I'd never actually considered. Maybe that's what made me afraid, not matching up to those lofty expectations I'd set in stone. I didn't want to delve on it any longer. I just wanted another cigarette.

The kaleidoscopic walls of the office building blended itself into a tangerine muse of teak stripes and amusing spaces, as I sludged my way back to our office area. Milo decided to pick up a coffee and a grin in the kitchen, her two modern staples which kept her regular. She stood there with her legs crossed, passing me a smile at me as we both waited for her coffee to brew. Hoping she wasn't secretly crumbling inside, ready to run outside and into on-coming traffic.

And then there was tonight's arrangement. Another interpersonal hurdle to overcome in this delorian urchin of lavish joy. Hoot. Hoot. Ho.

## Scene 3 END
