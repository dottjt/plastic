#### Scene 1 START

## Work Introduction

In work we trust. A plutocratic orgy of totalitarian devastation. This week's solution to the rampant "black" problem. Mornin' coffee. Mornin' wank. Mornin' grain. Margarine's tainted folly of hardened bliss, as your fingers attempts to pry the vogue from your eyes with a pompadour pickaxe. The diabolical mud seeps from your gums and into the heart of your Special-K, programming you into an undying commitment of useful, well-behaved utility. Shuckle up, bucko. It's time to cradle the flair.

## Touch Upon Editor Meeting

Following this morning's disastrous ousting with the editor, I was truly in no mood to sort paper, snort chaffer, nor entertain the upper soiree with my two-time tap-plastic beat. What I truly wanted was a gun and a live-animal to contest with. An outlet to express my debilitating sorrow, as I place my finger firm on the trigger emptying an entire magazine of 5.56 mm hollow point rounds into the head of a docile four-legged creature. Preferably in front of it's own fawn, as it cries idly by in native tongue. The hostess would then call me 'Big Akimbo' in honorary procession, as I stand there victorious in an uncompromising vision of success against the hardened tyranny of moral expectation. It's shrapnel-imbued carcass, to be held by it's hobble ears and smooched in a slobbering gob of ravioli slosh, as I grin awkwardly into the sun to be captured in photographic memory for our future generations to inspire. Clearly, I was starving.

## Stuck Outside

Ruffling through my coat, realising that I'd somehow misplaced my hall pass during today's earlier escapade, I couldn't help but stare blankly at the foreboding glass doors barring me from performing today's financial execution. My clothes reeking of the emulsified smells of pork and chive from the oriental dive bar earlier, an event which had spawned an all-out war between my brain and my stomach. Lost and in a state of sunken apprehension, I wasn't quite sure what to do, other than to consult the pea-sized grain of rationality that hadn't yet been consumed by the creeping anxiety confiscating my abiilty to stooge.

Was it in my best interest to grab a conveniently-located bench and use it as a battering ram in an act of terrorism, in an ode towards my humble loyalty for Capitalism? Where were the freely-available messenger pigeons at this time of day? Needlessly vain in their pickering counselling, they were an odd choice in these dreary times of need. Maybe the reasonable thing to do was call my boss, and pretend as if I'd caught some sort of medieval disease which prevented me from understanding the core fundamentals of Excel. Ah, yes. A fine day's work is truly never over. A kind of dibble-dabble affair that conspires to dribble you in the nonsensical pleasure of well-organised crime, lesser to the pagan beliefs you uphold as gospel upon God's almighty vision. A mechanical duet featuring your absolute best face in an air-tight vacuum of outstanding perfection, mired upon a palette of plastic purple laminate, suitably moulded into tiny matchsticks for your mouth to align. "Half a matchstick each day keeps ol' Maggie away from caressing ye ol' heart monitor!", murmurs a fading voice in the back of my mind, somewhat delirious in the poorly-received intention gushing from my skull.

## Milo Introduction

"I'm guessing you forgot your pass, again," approaches a pathless voice from the wide-open carpark fronting the technological fortress of torture and wires, fit with enough connective fibre to meet Ethiopia's anal porn needs. Judging by the snark prelude that emanated from her voice, there was no doubt in my mind it was Milo. The goddess of  whom littered my internet search history in an exploding file of mesmerising detail, I truly wanted nothing more than to grab her by the hair and fuck her senseless until the cataracts in my eyes bled green. It was too bad she knew nothing of my obsession, shrouded in the ripped veil of velvet rouge, only for my imagination to see. I dearly hoped she felt the same of me, although I knew it was wishful thinking.

"I guess I have indeed," as I stood there slightly enamoured with her presence. Well, it was more of an immediate obsession than it was a simple acknowledgement to be upheld. Those piercing Armenian eyes, wrapped thick in the shrill curls of a maniac-saviour. Ready to lure, attract and murder at an unintentional glance. Her body as slender and as elusive as the wisp of time itself, emancipated in a deformed stock of cigarette ash and compact opulence. It was everything I envisioned and more. I was sure there was an innate part of her brain that derived pleasure from drenching her lovers in coarse honey, before twisting them into all sorts of tautologically impossible shapes to be fucked and played with, or as she described, a short-stint in rehab. I'm sure my therapist wouldn't have been too happy with those thoughts.

Truth was, Milo was a bipolar baby. One minute she would be ecstatic, jumping about, grabbing you .  and . I don't know why I sexualise mental illness, perhaps because I was mentally ill myself. She appeared to be in a manic mood today. It's probably why she kissed me as she disappeared into the building.

#### Scene 2 START

## Describe Building

Through the bright cellophane interiors of the refurbished lobby and into the preliminary trust of the mind, a variety of wireframe chairs surrounding a manufactured see-through resin table, laid the Machine of Profit™ which bore the deceased flesh of a prominent businessman. Through prayer and worship, the ancient artifact existed to serve purpose to it's subjects, communicating through the extensive network of viridian tubes, abrassive in a retina display of conflicting messages. NOW. JUMP. UP. NOW. It was the life and blood of the company. The candy confectionary company for human waste, states the first div element of our website, hand-crafted in pure HTML by an autistic child with tiny keyboard inputs for fingers.

## Describe Receptionist

Latching themselves in an entwined ensemble of endless tranquility, an impressive assortment of exotic Pruvian vines which formed into the company's logo. A custom wood finish with a bit of slut. Below the logo, on an isolated desk ahead, sat the receptionist. A messy ball of anxious wool and tangled cat hair, stunned in the bright pink, yellow and orange knitted jumpers she would wear all over her voluptuous body. She was a small personality trapped behind a big self-conscious smile, hidden beneath a desecrated tub of Neopolitan ice-cream she left under her bed, conveniently finished without even a trace of dairy to harm a lactose-intolerant child. Of course, I also wanted to fuck her too. Definitely worth paying to see a cam show, at the very least.

"Good morning!", I shout, trying my best to sound like an all-inclusive trip to Disney Land.

"You know it's like, mid-afternoon, right?" Fuck. Just, fuck. I suppose it wasn't that bad. Maybe she found the aloofness attractive. My lovely self, that quirky asian wall-flower to be subtly admired with a nonchalant book on the intricate ironies of organic gardening. Perhaps it was an equivocal event to be pre-supposed by a romantic date on a sunset promenade, candle-lit in serene curiosity, followed by a weekend of average uninspired sex. Although I highly doubted my desirability as a man. No one wants to swipe right on the weird looking pervert licking his lips feverously at the sight of a bucket of chicken. Perhaps it was an extension of the self-hate that I felt for myself. The paradox of being Asian. Our own kind are too racist to fuck each other, yet too demanding to accept anything else than a perfect SAT score. At least in my mind, every romance was a mirage. I suspected most women were suspicious of Chinese men. Filthy chinks with a cushy for refined shirmp paste.

Perhaps I'd simply didn't care, because it conflicted what I wanted as a creep. A sick virtual fantasy of cum and gore, soiled all over the senses in a heap of used panties and unwashed lingerie, drenched in a cake of warm semen and indecent sweat. Mortal indecency sopping in the crimes of a sex-offender. Maybe that's what I should call my book.

## Orange back, Blue back

"Oh right, I had no idea," I remarked towards the reception, tattered with unconvincing smirk and my two thumbs up in a jovial point of discretion, now pacing myself through the vast cavern of the kitchen and to my desk, in a blitzkrieg of dirty thoughts and deranged requirements. Kaleidoscopic in a tangerine muse of teak stripes and amusing spaces, the office had a habit of revealing itself in the on-going tension between the two predominant factions haunting these halls. You were either an orange-back or a blue-back. A bottom-feeder or cut-throat liar. Usually it was obvious who was who, but it was those who blurred the lines of liquidity who truly left you afraid.

The orange-backs maintained the Machine of Profit™. Hardened loyalists with an obsessive personality of the highest degree. Fanatic in their pursuit for operational perfection, every single aspect of the Machine of Profit™ was documented, studied and lauded over in an entire library full of arcane functions, tested and praised for their striking simulation of outer reality. Thrifty scavengers with a gifted sense of time, orange-backs have been known to survive for weeks on end from the enamating moisture of their desks, an ability which has allowed them to work for days on end, without even a puddle of hue. An introverted cog of divine certification and low self-esteem, they were the ultimate servants to the establishment, vaticinal in their ability to optimise even the most basic of algorithms.

The blue-backs on the other hand were the very source of the Machine of Profit™ itself. The privileged emissaries which kept it's precious profits flowing, in a ritual of sacrifice known as the accordance. At the dot of every hour, two blue-backs would be chosen from the chantry by the high priest of profit, where they would simultaneously slit theirs wrists to provide sustainance to the ever-growing profit flowing from the glowing aura of the surfeit lands. Their bodies were then stripped of necessity and rubbed with a diamond adhesive of grandoise pomposity, soon to be fed into the Machine of Profit™. A beautiful death in the eyes of the communion, ready to be churned into profit for the greatness of the cause. It was the sole duty of the blue-back to churn, and a be churned. Their veins awash with the twadiness of vigour which kept their faces in deep attention with profit. Together they worked tireless to ensure that the money ran aflush, and their chains well lubricated.

## Describe Desk

Admittedly, I didn't really get the whole she-bang, as it were. I was nothing more than a sloucher with a dip in his walk. Another leech in the system to be powdered in caesin and stashed away for the apocalypse. Neither useful, nor indispensible. A self-sustaining pile of consistent trouble, enough to make my existence seem worthwhile. Another drifter with a sock for a shoe, cause the paper simply ain't gonna push itself out, honey. In the fluorscent blindness of my office space, the refraction of the sun onto the cluttered mess of my desk was a welcome touch to the hundreds of unanswered emails lurked within my mailbox. Warmth was a commodity in this office, forever displaced by the orange-back's desire to be thawed into a flawless image of cognnitive certainty, and the blue-back's inherent misandry for molten cleansing. Pushing aside a folder of printed pamphlets from last year's #excite conference, I sat patiently in my chair, entirely ready to get right back up and go home.

## Milo Conversation

"Hey, did you hear about the updated deadlines? I swear, it changes daily," Milo remarked, dispassionate at the seams in an untied flurry of sex hair and a penchant for dorty conversation.

"I have no idea," I respond, intense in my desire to remove myself from her presence. As much as I wanted to shove my hand into the seams of her dress, suckling on her tight pussy with the extent of my tongue, it was yet another a painful distraction from the thousands of clammy decisions grabbing at my brain, leaving me in a superflous state of despair. Sour in the way they cobbled along the square palazzi of choice, handled inside the dopamine-sized pockets bursting with elation. Pour the brandy into thy castle and deliver thy swine from thy depths of swell. Oh, ever-so swellish indeed. I was man who was born to win. To gather and disperse in complete declaration of the intent which I commanded like Turkish hellfire from the wrathe of the Dardanelles.

Well, at least all of this would hold true if the dreaded excesses of work didn't also lead to an almost debilitating level of self-harm, now manifesting itself into a compulsive desire to gouge your own bladder out with the edge of a disposable plastic knife, left ever-so keenly on the kitchen bench. A symbol of millenial how-to martyr in thy duty of unreasonable stress, delegated ever-so softly as a personality disorder with just the right amount of sparkle n' jazz to keep the leadership in a-buzz. Crinkle n' cut, Benny boy. It's time to solder those wounds shut and call it a day. I know that's exactly how our good friend Jesus would have wanted it. Devilishly recuperated within a 10 minute smoko which clearly got waaaayyy out of hand. It's a beautiful sight, as I gaze out into the foray of wild desks and fibre glass upholstry shimmering in the distance. Oh, what am I even saying. When was it home time?

## In work we trust

"In work we trust," preaches an overly-caffeinated woman sitting on-top of a repurposed milk crate, lactating uncontrollably through the red and white stripes of her luminous blouse. Veins firmly attached to the outer-rims of the patriarchy's pyrex mesh of pampered silence. "It's called leverage, silly", she claims in a jolly burst of hysteric miasma, as she points her finger towards the sky with a know-it-all grin. Mid-podcast, she turns her attention towards her computer screen, avidly licking her lips in an orgasmic laughter of despair, as she sensually contorts the crippling RSI in her hands, eyes caught in a casual dally with the company's Kanban Board of Innovation. Featuring an extensive spreadsheet of her most favourable physical attributes, it was the perfect checklist for the aspiring career-focused woman. Bloated Lips. Check. Fake Detachable Eyelashes. Check. Inflatable Silicone Breasts. Check. Bleached Pink Vagina? Still stuck in the Todo column, I see?

Ah well, that's a real shame and it might even cost her this year's promotion, however it's supple hastings here on the Mystery Mysogony Hour, as we invite everyone's favourite project manager to instigate this awful discrepancy. Well, it's official folks. The reports are in and unfortunately she's been an utter cunt of a "filthy bitch whore", prompting our beloved senior jockey to knock her out with his laptop stand and grope her massive breasts gushing with milky coalesce. He will then proceed to drag her limp body into a secure meeting room to be disfigured and raped, in swift preparation for an unidentifiable flurry of executive cock and caviar-littered cum. Involving at least half the sales floor and a freshly-picked intern trained purely in the art of gymnastic, it looks like we could be in for a real doozy, folks!

Men and children alike grab sections of her bruised body as it's dragged by in harmonious ceremony. "Take this poor women and guide her towards the top of patriarchy!", gleams an autistic man in an over-sized company sweater, gaff in a choking fit of insoluable lubricant following a sincere attempt to deep-throat a hard-drive full of high-resolution images of the CEO's junk. Unfortunately, it just ain't the same for ol' dick-weed here, what with his pronounced adam's apple and crippling inability to imitate a Disney-inspired blow-job. Fortunately however, eligible for his underage daughter who's just returned from rehab, proudly completing her 3rd stint in an all-inclusive five-star resort for anorexic over-achievers, following an unfortunate incident with a c-level executive and their new 'back-door' policy. Although I must admit, there's nothing quite like a carpal tunnel induced hand-job at three-to-ten in the afternoon, following an hour-long lecture on the cautionary reprimand of sexual harassment within the workplace. How I loathed the status quo.

## Milo Cigarette Invitation

"Well, it's a bit ridiculous, don't ya think? Anyway, I'm going out for a fag. Could I tempt you to join me?"

"You know I don't smoke."

"I saw your drunk at last year's Christmas party, Peter Pan. Flinging yourself around like a desperate chimney," she accused in a playful taunt of crass notoriety, dangling her second last cigarette in alluring transgression from the tip of her fingers. She pranced out of the room and into the foyer, exercising her petite silhouette through the light ethereal fabric adopting her skin, causing all sorts of devious mischievous in my mind. I only knew because I convinced myself to follow her out of the designated slaughter pen and into her colloquial embrace, in dire need of a light and a cigarette. Women really were the worst in the absolute best possible way, and she knew it herself. I think we may have been onto something.

#### Scene 3 START

##  Describe Smoking

Below the stark corridors of the cubular profit centre for methylated individuals, bore the imprint of 20th century industrialisation. An underground carpark the size of a 60,000 seat stadium, empty in it's glorious presentation, bar an old 1956 Holden which had been kept in immaculate condition since it's arrival. It was where the orange-backs liked to gather in droves, huddled in a sanctimonious profess of technical agility, as they sat there in their orange suits, licking discarded batteries by the bucket-full, afloat in an electrical buzz of drained competence. Ready to strike at any moment in a queer outburst of pan-fried lubricant. We made sure not to disturb their unrest.

"Ah, well, well. My sunken child. Ol' Ditto, my boy. It looks like the fatal grape has followed this hasty seed." She passed me her pouch of tobacco, le port royale, fit with papers and filters. It wholy excited me to know that I was going to smoke tobacco with papers she personally touched. It was as if I was inhaling bits of her vital essence, to be incorporated into my soul. I always found something sexual about smoking, in the casual degrade which mimiced the last scene in Romeo and Juliet. A gradual modern suicide pact for today's young people to enjoy.

## Discuss meeting with editor

"So, how did the meeting with the editor go? Same cunt like the last one?", she remarked, taking a long inconsequential drag on her thinly rolled slice of paradise.

"Pretty much. I couldn't say we gelled too well, he was a bit of a nut-job."

"Hey, at least you didn't have to blow him. You must have really put your heart and soul into that book, I assume it's why you barely showed up to work." She wasn't wrong. I could get at least 800 quality words done during my lunch break and another 3,000 words if I happened to have the flu that day. I'm sure faking cancer would haved allowed me at least another month worth of sick days to complete my second novel.

"Ah well, you know how it is. Churn in, churn out."

I wasn't sure if love quite described how I felt about Milo, but there was something magical which would coarse through my body each in a stretch of lavish joy, each and every time I looked at her. An uncontrollable surge of attraction, causing my eyes to glisten in a glee of transparent sincerity. Maybe it was because she was the only female I spent more than 30 minutes with each day, and I was nothing more than a desperate pile of pre-war matchsticks, excited to be struck into a flicker of puff.

## Flirt/Proposal

"Do you ever think about death?", she asked.

"Not really. Probably no more than most people. Why?"

"Like, let's say we were trapped down here and we only had five minutes to live before the building collapsed and crushed us. What would you do?"

Her question made me anxious. It felt a bit like having needles forced through my liver in an exercise of pre-marital self-care. Obviously, I wanted to fuck her. In almost every single way possible. But if it were that easy then I probably wouldn't have any self-esteem issues. She dipped her finger in her mouth, ditzy with a coy gesture of . She didn't seem right.

"I'd probably, uh..."

"Would you fuck me?", she unveiled, licking the outline of her lips with her wet pink tongue, gazing her eyes deeply into mine as if to suggest we were one.

"...and hold me, and tell me that everything was going to be okay as you rammed my tight little pussy?" I bit my lip.

"Yeah. Probably that."

My heart pounded into a schizophrenic drumbeat of pounding restlessness. What had just happened? Was this real? Was this finally happening? In a sense, felt like being eaten alive by a Lion. My arms limp from the impact-trauma of smashing my head against a rock, as it's large teeth tore through my legs, snapping bone n' blood into a sludge of stomach acid.

"Then take me out this Friday night. Will you do that for me?", she gasped in a vulnerable, childish voice, whispering her words with an intricate frown, as she approached closer and closer towards me, before eventually holding her hand out to the tip of my chin for my mouth to kiss.

"Yeah, sure. I can do that. I would love to do that. Do you have my number?"

## Elevator ride back

We chatted casually about key deliverables on the elevator ride back up to the kitchen, subtly shaken by the events prior. Although it was something I'd always wanted, it also didn't feel natural. Something which also filled me with anxiety, like trying to tee a golf ball inside a glass dome. That I didn't even have the courage to ask her out myself. I still wasn't quite sure what even happened in those moments. I was both glad and sad. A glasim, if you will.

As I sludged my way back to our office area, Milo decided to pick up a coffee and a grin, two things I'd very rarely seen her without. Sitting down with her legs cross, she smiled at me from her desk, battered in the light consistency of a French dough. Perhaps she shared the same feelings that I had for her. Perhaps she had simply broken down. I wasn't quite sure, but it still made me hard.
