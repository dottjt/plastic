## Scene 1 START

### Depression Monologue
<!--
"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro-rata amidst a cheerless harmony of subversive glee, as these words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of circular needles and profane blather. The paraxial of thy gracious word, spectacularly contoured in a harlem of distasteful abjection, like the Dead Recurved Skunk of St. Nicholas' grave which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides the knurled quandry grasping at it's toes.

Cheeky, in an attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of nuts. Hilarious, in the laughter which ensues. The crowd applauses. The Skunk staves night for one more day and the after party is wild in it's veneration of critique. Breasts are held. Champange is saundered. The Skunk is esteemed. What a great day for comedy in this kowtow of pudicity, modest in the absurdity nibbling at your woes. Although in keeping relevant with my response, I simply yawned at the review, testament to my perception as Queen in this bizzare brute resilience of both force and sensuality.

Victorian mal-la-la-laise. Oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the faint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, dear? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the edge of your HEART so you can SATIRISE your own MALTREATMENT!?" I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef!", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another glass of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of the mind. A fallous attempt to withdraw my arrival from the world, and instead subside into the fabulous nooks and crannies of evaluation's eroded retreat. Cyclical cycle. Delicious tampoon. Where will you be when you lick my gloom. Et al.

### Describe Imagined Reality

"Yes, sour grapes make for a chaffy treat," I announce, as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pitter-patter scene of the Crimean rug below. Accomplice to the delicate spine which hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp cold walls supporting it's fine intrepidation into the literary foray of one's own imagination. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing going on. Something illegitimate brewing in my mind. Infected by a coarse undertone of heightened anxiety, attempting to hijack my neurons with an uncanny chatter. Musing over my follicles and leeching into my skin.

### Explain the lie

It's apparent there's trouble. A whole defeated Skunk of trouble. A vial of fear, swallowed in whole. I am fear. I am vial. Afraid of the thought and the orient. Afraid of himself. Unrecognisable in his own flesh and blood. Torn straight from a book of whimsical lies, concocted with a magical staff of lyrical deception. The words. My pen. Our lies. It sighs. Goodbye. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. I am alone. Perched upon my bed. Contorted in writhe. Blanketed by a surreal emptiness that cannot be reasoned with. Mired in a vanishing falseness. A passing moment through the vague openness of time. Maintaining it's distance with my soul. It's ever-reaching permissiveness, offering genuine refuge in a chamber of despair. "Come with me," it whispers, holding my hand like an innocent child guiding me through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all-alluring connection, pinching me with a quaint slap of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, disguised as a romantic escapade into the cannular reverberations of insufferable me, slamming into my ear and clogging my dull. Shut up and taste the jambo. Pockey huck.

### The morning struggle

I wondered to myself. Depleted in my struggle. Enthralled by the gristle of my chin, scraping against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my worldly disenchantment with the unsightly premise of enthusiasm itself. I look up from the below the covers and into the charm of my youth. 10:20am. That couldn't have been good for the kidneys. The yupies are unimpressed. They chant hymns of sacrifice. My death, to be celebrated post-breakfast with a rash of English bacon and sailor's bisket. My body, to be merged into society like the long-foregone conclusion of oxidised gum, to be discovered and approached by a 20-something-year-old cleaner on the intangible underside of a train station bench. Hard n' gunky. Another peace treaty to be clamored and adored with protective rubber gloves, and fed back into the system without a day's notice, nor care. I shake off the protruding dread with a muddy sigh, as I attempt to pull the sheets from under my body. It's no use. My arms had already become molten planks of dense reinforcement, sunk inside the gelatine goop that was my resolve. I had simply become.

### Talk about guilt
-->

Maybe I felt guilt over the way I treated my mother, as I stood there unconstitutional in a compromised three-way of apartheid emotion. Anger, sadness and blame. All attempting to pick my corpse in an abundant free-for-all of rape and violence. Ripping and pulling it's way into my heart in an unrelenting rage of Malthusian precedence. Long outlasting my original desire to simply escape her abuse and live my life free. Or was I the abuse I feared? I wasn't quite sure what to believe, as the question grappled with my mind. Addling what little energy I had to maintain posture.

Sometimes, it felt as if I granted myself permission to be an awful person. To express how little I could care as a human being, in the all-consuming hatred I reared and gathered. A hatred which was so certain in my own mind, yet so far removed from the kind words of deception attempting to lull me back into a state of calm. I wasn't even sure why I hated my mother so much, only that I was convinced the pain and judgement that I felt from her was real. The hurt which shoved it's precious little fingers into my pie and left me vomitting all over myself in an episode of gastro. My anger and sorrow, nothing more than an immediate reaction to the tumor I recognised as a blight on this earth. Perhaps I was the abuse, in my quest to kill hope. I was the self-righteous donkey and this was my pretend.

### Mother's Text/Decides to smoke weed

I receive a text from my mother. Oh, for fuck's sake, will she just leave me alone already? In a lot of ways, my overwhelming hatred for my mother was nothing more than a state of mind which my brain had been trained to default to. Like when a child sighs at the thought of doing homework, I simply wanted to use her face as a rake to comfort the rocks in my patio. Thankfully, these particular rocks have been known to contain abundant feng-shui, a detail I'm sure her face would delight. I pick myself up from my bed and make my way to the bathroom, poking the skin of my naked body in the shape of a pea. Gasping in front of the mirror. Short of breath. Hopelessly suffocating in what little I knew about myself. Faltering it's signal in overlapping patterns. Perhaps my body was attempting to physically cry. To express how little it wanted to live. Perhaps I'd simply feel better after a wake n' bake. Yeah. That's what I needed. A universal craving without a suitable name. The textile of green.

## Scene 2 START

### Describe desk

Abdula's Potato. Papier-mâché cables. The desk which swore. The distant protest of disposable coffee cups, forming unions in favour of improved recycle times. The cameo floor lamp brimming a surly mayonnaise-green, dribbling sautéed light across a parsley landscape of twaddled fortunes. The allure of creep. The dried husk of a once-thriving plant, utterly cremated by the inaugural toxicity of it's environment. A plume of mould gathers in presumptuous ways, infecting the wooden handles containing all sorts of grim. A raunchy porno stolen from an internet cafe. A souless reminder of youth. Perhaps I simply wanted to feel invalid. To feel my emotions pulverised to mush, recycled and thrown into a tumbler for further obfuscation. Pantyhose smoke. Languid heave.

### Talk about weed usage

Perhaps weed wasn't entirely necessary for my survival, although my brain certainly didn't know any better. As far as it was concerned, drugs were an entirely necessary addition to my existence, perhaps even compromising of existence itself, inflating the insular hope which clouded my lungs and left me in an a glaze of fine China. I don't remember when I first started smoking weed, only that it was a tradition which had relegated itself to weekends. First you gain sentience. Then you inhale. Then you disperse, packing the sucker as hard as you can until your lungs collapse and you find yourself chewing on the hard excess of dopamine for weeks on end. I safely kept my weed in a glass-jar next to a modified Gatorade bottle, stitched together with cut government piping and a patch of aluminium foil. A circular edge along an epaxial line. I grind the weed and I put my headphones on. It's looks like we're gold again.

### Describe study

The study was never a particularly theraputic room. In front of me, a diptych screenprint of an flourescent orange revolver, captured in various shades of parralax aberration.

Above me hung a 1957 issue of the American flag, 48 stars, .


### Talk about food binge.

Usually my plan was to buy as much junk as possible from the supermarket. We're talkin' polyvinyl sticks. White-label lasagna. Cheesy cowboy stringers. Ballistic adhesive. Those fizzy fucks. All variations of sugary goodness, to be packed into tight tubes for convenience, and blasted into the confines of my pores so that not a single cell of my vital organs would survive the impending failure of my arteries in a synaptic whiplash of nerve damage. I would then proceed to purge so I could consume more. I soon discovered and approached that I would enjoy the feeling of purging more than I did eating, which lead me to eat even more, so I could purge more often. I suppose I consoled in the fact that you always knew you were going to feel better post-purge. Epicurean catharticism, dressed in an acidic bile of good-will. The blessings of the pope upon thee.

### The depression of bipolar

Ultimately, I wasn't even sure why I did it. Perhaps it just made me feel cool. The self-loathing of incapacitation. To return myself to

I rose up out of my chair and headed for the door. A putty of pineal hormones, not quite so determined to seek plenary assembly in this chamber of partite inequality.
