<!-- Self-perceived reality -->

"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro rata in cowboy fashion, as these cheerless words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of circular needles and bad allegories. Dead as the recurved skunk which lies without faith in the tall notched grass besides a lifetime of self-abuse and knurled quandary, sneaking itself scalloped into the vice of our dreams in an attempt to tell a joke about the inequality of NUTS. Victorian times, oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the feint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, sweetie? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to your heart so you can just FEEL!?!"

I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, lost in the thick unease permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself a drink, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of my mind, withdrawing my arrival from the world and into the dark nooks and crannies of my mind."

"Yes, sour grapes make a chaffy treat," the wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the Persian rug below. The delicate spine hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp, cold walls supporting his fine trepidation into the literary foray. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing, something brewing in my mind, infecting my neurons with an uncanny chatter - musing over the wrinkles and follicles leeching from my face. It's apparent there's trouble, because the man is afraid. He is inside me and he does not recognise his own reflection.

The glass is not real. The wine, is certainly not real. Alone in this room was a surreal emptiness.

I don't quite know what's going on right now, however I feel quaint.

I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull roundness.
"Don't fall off the train," they said. 

"It only comes once every two years, so unless if you're willing to choo, choo, choo - you better know your place, or be culled." 

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. 

Fuck you rabbit. Fuck you indeed.

The gristle on my chin stuck like cheap candy to the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of .
