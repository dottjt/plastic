<!-- Self-perceived reality -->

"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro rata in cheerless harmony of , as these subversive words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of circular needles and profane blather. Dead unlike the recurved skunk which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides knurled quandary grasping at it's toes, sneaking itself scalloped into the vice of our dreams in a cheeky attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of ethically-sourced nuts. Victorian times, oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the feint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, sweetie? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the edge of your heart so you can satirise my maltreatment!?"

I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another drink of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of my mind, withdrawing my arrival from the world in a sudden snap of attention, embarking my riches into the fabulous nooks and crannies of insecurity's eroded retreat.

"Yes, sour grapes make a chaffy treat," as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pit-patter of the Persian rug below. A delicate spine hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp, cold walls supporting it's fine trepidation into literary foray. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing, something brewing in my mind, infecting my neurons with an uncanny chatter - musing over the wrinkles and follicles leeching from my face and into my skin. It's apparent there's trouble, a whole defeated sunk of loss and perish, because this man is afraid. He is afraid of the thought and the orient. He is afraid of the man that is himself, unrecognisable in his own blood and flesh. And yet he lies, because he is afraid. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. Alone in my room, perched at the end of my bed, was this surreal emptiness that could not be reasoned with. It was subtle, mired in vanishing falseness, like a passing moment through the vastness of open space. Yet it's ever-reaching permissiveness offered a kind of genuine refuge which could not be argued with, like it served to teach you something sanctimonious about very foundations of life itself. "Come with me," it whispers, holding your hand like an innocent child showing guiding you through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all an alluring premise with a quaint pinch of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, which these words disguise as a romantic escapade into cannular reverberations these ears yearn to share.

"What am I doing," I wonder, depleted in the struggle of my confusion. The gristle on my chin scrapes against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my disenchantment with the world. I look up from the below the covers and into the indicator of my youth. 10:20am. That can't be good for the kidneys. Merged like oxidised gum to a bench at the train station,

Maybe I felt guilt over the way I treated my mother.

I don't quite know what's going on right now, however I feel quaint.

I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull insensitivity to .

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat-fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. Fuck you rabbit. Fuck you indeed.

As I stare at my naked body in the front of the bathroom mirror, I found myself gasping. Short of breath. Hopelessly grasping at something I didn't quite know was there. Suffocating. Faltering in a muddled

Maybe I'd feel better after a wake n' bake. Yeah, that's what I needed. It was time to degrade. I safely kept my weed in a glass-jar amongst all the . I always used a bong, made of a retrofitted gatorade bottle and cut government piping.

I would go as far as to write erotica for them.
