### Self-perceived reality - enthralling

"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro-rata in a cheerless harmony of subversive glee, as these words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of circular needles and profane blather. Dead. Dead. Dead. Like the Dead Recurved Skunk of St. Nicholas' grave, which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides the knurled quandry grasping at it's toes, sneaking itself scalloped into the vice of your dreams. Cheeky in an attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of nuts. Hilarious. You laugh. The crowd applauses. The Skunk receives enough misplaced attention to stave off suicide for one more night. The after party is wild. What a great day for comedy.

Victorian mal-la-la-laise. Oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the feint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, sweetie? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the EDGE of your heart so you can SATIRISE my maltreatment!?" I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease, permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef!", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another glass of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of my mind. A fallous attempt to withdraw my arrival from the world, where in a sudden snap of attention, I decide to embark my riches into the fabulous nooks and crannies of insecurity's eroded retreat. Cyclical cycle. Delicious tampoon.

"Yes, sour grapes make for a chaffy treat," as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pitter-patter of the Crimean rug below. Accomplice to the delicate spine which hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp cold walls supporting it's fine intrepidation into the literary foray of one's own imagination. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing going on, something illegitimate brewing in my mind. Infected by a coarse undertone of heightened anxiety, attempting to hijack my neurons with an uncanny chatter, musing over the wrinkles and follicles leeching from my face and into my skin.

It's apparent there's trouble. A whole defeated Skunk of trouble. A vial of fear, swallowed in whole. I am fear. I am vial. Afraid of the thought and the orient. Afraid of himself. Unrecognisable in his own flesh and blood. Torn straight from an antiquated book of whimsical lies, concocted with a magical staff of lyrical deception. The words. My pen. Our lies. It sighs. Goodbye. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. I am alone in my room. Perched upon my bed. Contorted in writhe. Blanketed by a surreal emptiness that cannot be reasoned with. Mired in a vanishing falseness. A passing moment through the vast openness of time. Maintaining it's distance with your soul. It's ever-reaching permissiveness, offering genuine refuge. "Come with me," it whispers, holding your hand like an innocent child guiding you through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all-alluring connection, pinching you with a quaint slap of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, disguised as a romantic escapade into the cannular reverberations slamming your ear. Shut up and taste the blather. Hockey puck.

I wondered to myself. Depleted in my struggle. Enthralled by the gristle of my chin, scraping against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my worldly disenchantment. I look up from the below the covers and into the charm of my youth. 10:20am. That couldn't have been good for the kidneys. The yupies are unimpressed. I will be sacrificed. My death, to be celebrated post-breakfast. My body, to be merged into society like oxidised gum, found on the intangible underside of a train station bench. A permanent waste to be clamored with rubber gloves. Hard n' gunky. Friday's mistake. I shake off the protruding dread with a muddy sigh, as I attempt to pull the sheets from under my body. It was no use. My arms had become planks, sunk inside the gelatine goop that was my resolve. I was liar.

### Talk about guilt

Maybe I felt guilt over the way I treated my mother. A tidal disowning the equal parts anger, sadness and shame, stabbing me senseless in an abundant free-for-all of rape and violence. Trampling upon my ability to amend, engaging in a visicious civil war of pretend. A bloody triangle of equal equivalence, fumbling it's way through into the drull beat of my heart. Throbbing in a quaint requiem of on-going misery, ripping and pulling my star-studded torso with the actions of my past. Sometimes, it felt as if I granted myself permission to be an awful person. To express how little I could care as a human being. To allow myself to become so absolutely consumed in hatred, that it probably deserved it's own name. A hatred which was so certain in my own mind, yet so far from how I was feeling in this moment. I wasn't even sure why I hated my mother so much, only that I knew the pain and judgement that I felt from her was real. Some would say, alive. The hurt which shoved it's precious little fingers into my pie and left me vomitting all over myself in an episode of gastro. My anger and sorrow, nothing more than an immediate reaction to the tumor I recognised as a blight on this earth. I was the self-righteous donkey.

In a lot of ways, my overwhelming hatred for my mother was nothing more than a state of mind which my brain had been trained to default to. Like when a child sighs at the thought of doing homework, I simply wanted to use her face as a rake to comfort the rocks in my patio. Thankfully, these particular rocks have been known to contain abundant feng-shui, a detail I'm sure her face would delight. I pick myself up from my bed and make my way to the bathroom, poking the skin of my naked body in the shape of a pea. Gasping in front of the mirror. Short of breath. Hopelessly suffocating in what little I knew about myself. Faltering it's signal in overlapping patterns. Perhaps my body was attempting to physically cry. To express how little it wanted to live. Perhaps I'd simply feel better after a wake n' bake. Yeah. That's what I needed. It was time to degrade.

### Weed

Abdula's Potato. A black papermache cable. The desk which swore. Rows of disposable coffee cups form unions in a chain of dispute, protested in favour of improved recycle times. The cameo floor lamp brims a surly mustard green, dribbling sautéed light across a landscape of twaddled fortunes. The allure of creep. Infecting the wooden draw handles containing all sorts of grim. A plume of mould gathers in presumptuous ways, .

Perhaps weed wasn't entirely necessary for my survival, although my brain didn't know otherwise. As far as it was concerned, drugs were an entirely necessary addition to my existence. Perhaps even compromising of my existence altogether. The insular hope which clouded my lungs and left me in a

I don't remember when I first started smoking weed, only that it was an on-going weekend routine. First you gain sentience. Then you inhale. Gathering as much dopamine as humanly possible, to be dispersed into life as you please.

I safely kept my weed in a glass-jar amongst all the , and I always used a bong. A modified Gatorade bottle, stitched together with cut government piping.

Usually my plan was to buy as much as much junk as possible from the supermarket. We're talkin' .

Then I would purge so I could consume more. Admittedly I enjoyed the feeling of emptying my stomach. No matter what, you could always console in the fact that you were going to feel better afterwards. Purging was the ultimate cathartic

I put on my headphones and we're gold again.

This was how men coped.
