## Scene 1 START

### Depression Monologue

"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro-rata amidst a cheerless harmony of subversive glee. The paraxial of thy gracious word, dragging thyself miserably along a serrated tarmac of profane lunacy and modest respite. Specularly contoured in a harlem of abjection, like the Dead Recurved Skunk of St. Nicholas' grave, which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides the knurled quandry grasping at it's toes.

Cheeky, in an attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of nuts. Hilarious, in the laughter which ensues. The crowd applauses. The Skunk staves night for one more day, and the after party is wild in it's veneration of critique. The Skunk is esteemed. Breasts are held. Champange is saundered. What a great day for comedy in this kowtow of pudicity, misplaced in the absurdity nibbling at your woes. Although in keeping relevant with my response, I simply yawned at the review, testament to my perception as Queen in this brute resilience of force and sensuality.

Victorian mal-la-la-laise. Oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the feint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, sweetie? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the EDGE of your HEART so you can SATIRISE my MALTREATMENT!?" I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef!", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another glass of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of my mind. A fallous attempt to withdraw my arrival from the world, where in a sudden snap of attention, I decide to embark my riches into the fabulous nooks and crannies of evaluation's eroded retreat. Cyclical cycle. Delicious tampoon. Where will you be when you lick my gloom. Et al.

### Describe Imagined Reality

"Yes, sour grapes make for a chaffy treat," as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pitter-patter of the Crimean rug below. Accomplice to the delicate spine which hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp cold walls supporting it's fine intrepidation into the literary foray of one's own imagination. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing going on. Something illegitimate brewing in my mind. Infected by a coarse undertone of heightened anxiety, attempting to hijack my neurons with an uncanny chatter, musing over my follicles and leeching into my skin.

### Explain the lie

It's apparent there's trouble. A whole defeated Skunk of trouble. A vial of fear, swallowed in whole. I am fear. I am vial. Afraid of the thought and the orient. Afraid of himself. Unrecognisable in his own flesh and blood. Torn straight from a book of whimsical lies, concocted with a magical staff of lyrical deception. The words. My pen. Our lies. It sighs. Goodbye. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. I am alone. Perched upon my bed. Contorted in writhe. Blanketed by a surreal emptiness that cannot be reasoned with. Mired in a vanishing falseness. A passing moment through the vast openness of time. Maintaining it's distance with my soul. It's ever-reaching permissiveness, offering genuine refuge. "Come with me," it whispers, holding my hand like an innocent child guiding me through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all-alluring connection, pinching me with a quaint slap of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, disguised as a romantic escapade into the cannular reverberations slamming into my ear. Shut up and taste the blather. Pockey huck.

### The morning struggle

I wondered to myself. Depleted in my struggle. Enthralled by the gristle of my chin, scraping against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my worldly disenchantment. I look up from the below the covers and into the charm of my youth. 10:20am. That couldn't have been good for the kidneys. The yupies are cringing and my . I will be sacrificed. My death, to be celebrated post-breakfast. My body, to be merged into society like oxidised gum, found on the intangible underside of a train station bench. A permanent waste to be clamored with rubber gloves. Hard n' gunky. Friday's mistake. I shake off the protruding dread with a muddy sigh, as I attempt to pull the sheets from under my body. It was no use. My arms had become planks, sunk inside the gelatine goop that was my resolve. I was liar.

### Talk about guilt

Maybe I felt guilt over the way I treated my mother. A tidal disowning the equal parts anger, sadness and shame, stabbing me senseless in an abundant free-for-all of rape and violence. Trampling upon my ability to amend, engaging in a visicious civil war of pretend. A bloody triangle of equal equivalence, fumbling it's way through into the drull beat of my heart. Throbbing in a quaint requiem of on-going misery, ripping and pulling my star-studded torso with the actions of my past. Sometimes, it felt as if I granted myself permission to be an awful person. To express how little I could care as a human being. To allow myself to become so absolutely consumed in hatred, that it probably deserved it's own name. A hatred which was so certain in my own mind, yet so far from how I was feeling in this moment. I wasn't even sure why I hated my mother so much, only that I knew the pain and judgement that I felt from her was real. Some would say, alive. The hurt which shoved it's precious little fingers into my pie and left me vomitting all over myself in an episode of gastro. My anger and sorrow, nothing more than an immediate reaction to the tumor I recognised as a blight on this earth. I was the self-righteous donkey.

### Mother's Text/Decides to smoke weed

I receive a text from my mother. Oh, for fuck's sake, will she just leave me alone already? In a lot of ways, my overwhelming hatred for my mother was nothing more than a state of mind which my brain had been trained to default to. Like when a child sighs at the thought of doing homework, I simply wanted to use her face as a rake to comfort the rocks in my patio. Thankfully, these particular rocks have been known to contain abundant feng-shui, a detail I'm sure her face would delight. I pick myself up from my bed and make my way to the bathroom, poking the skin of my naked body in the shape of a pea. Gasping in front of the mirror. Short of breath. Hopelessly suffocating in what little I knew about myself. Faltering it's signal in overlapping patterns. Perhaps my body was attempting to physically cry. To express how little it wanted to live. Perhaps I'd simply feel better after a wake n' bake. Yeah. That's what I needed. A universal craving without a suitable name. The textile of green.

## Scene 2 START

### Describe desk

Abdula's Potato. Papier-mâché cables. The desk which swore. The distant protest of disposable coffee cups, forming unions in favour of improved recycle times. The cameo floor lamp brimming a surly mayonnaise-green, dribbling sautéed light across a parsley landscape of twaddled fortunes. The allure of creep. The dried husk of a once-thriving plant, utterly cremated by the inaugural toxicity of it's environment. A plume of mould gathers in presumptuous ways, infecting the wooden handles containing all sorts of grim. A raunchy porno stolen from an internet cafe. A souless reminder of youth. Perhaps I simply wanted to feel invalid. To feel my emotions pulverised to mush, recycled and thrown into a tumbler for further obfuscation. Pantyhose smoke. Languid heave.

### Talk about weed usage

Perhaps weed wasn't entirely necessary for my survival, although my brain certainly didn't know any better. As far as it was concerned, drugs were an entirely necessary addition to my existence, perhaps even compromising of existence itself, inflating the insular hope which clouded my lungs and left me in an a glaze of fine China. I don't remember when I first started smoking weed, only that it was a tradition which had relegated itself to weekends. First you gain sentience. Then you inhale. Then you disperse, packing the sucker as hard as you can until your lungs collapse and you find yourself chewing on the hard excess of dopamine for weeks on end. I safely kept my weed in a glass-jar next to a modified Gatorade bottle, stitched together with cut government piping and a patch of aluminium foil. A circular edge along an epaxial line. I grind the weed and I put my headphones on. It's looks like we're gold again.

### Describe study

The study was never a particularly theraputic room. In front of me, a diptych screenprint of an flourescent orange revolver, captured in various shades of parralax aberration.

Above me hung a 1957 issue of the American flag, 48 stars, .


### Talk about food binge.

Usually my plan was to buy as much junk as possible from the supermarket. We're talkin' polyvinyl sticks. White-label lasagna. Cheesy cowboy stringers. Ballistic adhesive. Those fizzy fucks. All variations of sugary goodness, to be packed into tight tubes for convenience, and blasted into the confines of my pores so that not a single cell of my vital organs would survive the impending failure of my arteries in a synaptic whiplash of nerve damage. I would then proceed to purge so I could consume more. I soon discovered that I would enjoy the feeling of purging more than I did eating, which lead me to eat even more, so I could purge more often. I suppose I consoled in the fact that you always knew you were going to feel better post-purge. Epicurean catharticism, dressed in an acidic bile of good-will. The blessings of the pope upon thee.

### The depression of bipolar

Ultimately, I wasn't even sure why I did it. Perhaps it just made me feel cool. The self-loathing of incapacitation. To return myself to

I rose up out of my chair and headed for the door. A putty of pineal hormones, not quite so determined to seek plenary assembly in this chamber of partite inequality.
