## Scene 1 START

<!--
### Self-perceived reality - enthralling

"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro-rata in a cheerless harmony of subversive glee, as these words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of circular needles and profane blather. Dead. Dead. Dead. Like the Dead Recurved Skunk of St. Nicholas' grave, which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides the knurled quandry grasping at it's toes, sneaking itself scalloped into the vice of your dreams. Cheeky in an attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of nuts. Hilarious. You laugh. The crowd applauses. The Skunk receives enough misplaced attention to stave off suicide for one more night. The after party is wild. What a great day for comedy.

Victorian mal-la-la-laise. Oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the feint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, sweetie? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the EDGE of your heart so you can SATIRISE my maltreatment!?" I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease, permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef!", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another glass of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of my mind. A fallous attempt to withdraw my arrival from the world, where in a sudden snap of attention, I decide to embark my riches into the fabulous nooks and crannies of insecurity's eroded retreat. Cyclical cycle. Delicious tampoon.

"Yes, sour grapes make for a chaffy treat," as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pitter-patter of the Crimean rug below. Accomplice to the delicate spine which hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp cold walls supporting it's fine intrepidation into the literary foray of one's own imagination. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing going on, something illegitimate brewing in my mind. Infected by a coarse undertone of heightened anxiety, attempting to hijack my neurons with an uncanny chatter, musing over the wrinkles and follicles leeching from my face and into my skin.

It's apparent there's trouble. A whole defeated Skunk of trouble. A vial of fear, swallowed in whole. I am fear. I am vial. Afraid of the thought and the orient. Afraid of himself. Unrecognisable in his own flesh and blood. Torn straight from an antiquated book of whimsical lies, concocted with a magical staff of lyrical deception. The words. My pen. Our lies. It sighs. Goodbye. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. I am alone in my room. Perched upon my bed. Contorted in writhe. Blanketed by a surreal emptiness that cannot be reasoned with. Mired in a vanishing falseness. A passing moment through the vast openness of time. Maintaining it's distance with your soul. It's ever-reaching permissiveness, offering genuine refuge. "Come with me," it whispers, holding your hand like an innocent child guiding you through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all-alluring connection, pinching you with a quaint slap of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, disguised as a romantic escapade into the cannular reverberations slamming your ear. Shut up and taste the blather. Hockey puck.

"What am I doing?", I wondered to myself. Depleted in my struggle. Enthralled by the gristle on my chin, scraping against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my disenchantment with the world. I look up from the below the covers and into the charm of my youth. 10:20am. That can't be good for the kidneys. The yupies are unimpressed. I will be sacrificed. My death, to be celebrated post-breakfast, in a world where celebrities are mere baristers. Sleep-deprived toddlers with an aggressive high school education. Merged into society like oxidised gum, found on the intangible underside of train station corridors. Clamoring for your attention. Hard n' gunky. Friday's mistake. I shake off the protruding dread with a muddy sigh, as I attempt to pull the sheets from under my body. It was no use. My arms had become inelastic planks of wood, sunk inside what had become a gelatine of goop. Dog shit cloaked in chocolate sprinkles. Enjoy the funk, cum daddy.

### Talk about guilt

Maybe I felt guilt over the way I treated my mother, my emotions still smack-bang in the middle of a vicious civil war. Anger, sadness, self-righteousness. Equally caught in a quaint requiem of on-going misery. Fumbling my way through the drull beat in my heart, all I could feel was my star-studded torso being pulled and ripped apart by the actions of my past. Sometimes, it feels like I'm granted permission to be an awful person. To express how little my emotions would allow me to feel and to become so absolutely consumed in hatred, to a point where my eyes would feel sore for days. I wasn't exactly sure why I hated my mother so much, but it felt so right, so integral to my experience as a human being. The pain. The judgement. The hurt which shoved it's precious little fingers into my gut. Yet it just was. My anger and my sorrow, nothing more than an immediate reaction to the tumor I recognised as a blight on this earth to excuse and

It was a state of mind which my brain had defaulted to. Certainly, I believe that I always had this anger inside me, merely that I

Japanese AV models were the closest thing I ever had to a mother.


### Existential Crisis

I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull insensitivity to .

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat-fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. Fuck you rabbit. Fuck you indeed.

As I stare at my naked body in the front of the bathroom mirror, I found myself gasping. Short of breath. Hopelessly grasping at something I didn't quite know was there. Suffocating. Faltering in a muddled

I wanted to feel.

What did it mean to cope?

Maybe I'd feel better after a wake n' bake. Yeah, that's what I needed. It was time to degrade.

### Weed

Fly away

I safely kept my weed in a glass-jar amongst all the .



I always used a bong, made of a retrofitted gatorade bottle and cut government piping.


Usually my plan was to buy as much as much junk as possible from the supermarket. We're talkin' .

Then I would purge so I could consume more. Admittedly I enjoyed the feeling of emptying my stomach. No matter what, you could always console in the fact that you were going to feel better afterwards. Purging was the ultimate cathartic

### Cam girl

I loved cam girls. I mean, that's what they were there for. To be believed. To be loved. To provide some kind of

I mean, I would never pay for them, but I would willing give myself up to them.
As I



I would go as far as to write erotica for them.

I came into my hands, cusping the overflowing semen in the rim of my index finger. Then I reach for the tissue to clean up the mess. It was the same routine of glue and bleached tree wafer, scrumped into a ball and buried deep underground to be turned into fossilised shame. I always wondered if my addiction was a form of self-hate. A way to express how much I didn't like myself. I couldn't logically comprehend why I did it, but when your eyes are fixed on some blonde getting t-boned by two black men with a high school education, it turned you sour.

. Why I stared at a screen

I cover my eyes with my hands. A white-ish blue. I suppose it had meaning.
