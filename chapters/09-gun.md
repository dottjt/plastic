## Scene 1 START

### Wallet Monologue.

You stare at your wallet. It stares back. There's money, but it looks sick. It is devoid of culture. It is without faith. A venture of pity. So you give it a home. A home in your heart. You decorate it with colour and quantity. For it to become your new loyal best friend. Yet you realise your offering is paltry. It is still without culture. It lingers for a soul. So you begin to worship the notes, validating the crisp outline of it's lilac surface. Embracing the judgement it strikes upon you with fear. The power of the divine. Now when you look at your wallet, you notice nothing but pride. The mystique of a millionaire, at a fraction of the dime. Your wallet is lordship. Your wallet has priest.

### Describe Tampons / Milo

The weekly shop. Danger's quinn. I walk past a packet of tampons. A menstrual pleasure enthralled in the candid exasperation of a desperate lowlife. A murky sign of affection. The golden trickle of nostalgia, reminding you of how weak you truly are. I'd try to eat them, but they reminded me too much of Milo. Her erratic touch. The boiled ingenuity of her misanthropic mind. Washed out against the afflictive sleaze of mindless inconsequence. More than anything, I simply wanted to hold her. Perhaps more than I wanted to be held. Merely as a sign of my own hospitalised desires, now working against me in a defective ward of malevolent circumstance. Locking her away in a blighted cage, never to be realised again. I walk past a healthy young couple. They seemed happy. Despair. Reason to plunge my colostrum hand into a vat of butter and drown my sorrows out in the creamy goodness of pasturised opulence. Although peppy with my remarks, I had no idea what I needed to maintain my minimal function. I would have been happy to simply perish in the soles of these shoes, to be permanently transferred away to a happier place where the heaviness in my heart could be free.

### Describe the store

Shell-shocked and without care, I continued to my narcissistic plea inside the interior of the large department store, now left in the capable hands of consumerist advertising to guide me towards an ideal set of nutritional choices. I embarked into what seemed like a vernacular of aluminum cans and toasted boxes, I couldn't help but notice the loneliness of the infirmary white aisles. Radiating an unrelenting beam of UV into the cornea of my eye, incinerating all bacteria amongst the cardboard cities of crackers n' blue pastes drifting in amongst the discount stickers begging you boutique fallacy. I place my hand on a container of coffee. Do I even drink coffee? Well, I do now, as I placed it half-willingly into the hand basket weighing me down. Soiling my mood in gloom.

The aromatic disparity of the meekly roasted chickens grabs me and cuts into my wiring. This is what men swore. Creamy pasta salad. Thank you, sir. Tins of tins of tins. Reconstituted tallow. Clog me, baby. Thunder-fuck me in shame. Forget the greens. Antioxidonts. Mac n' Cheese was fair game, and although I was unsure as to how I was going to haul several dozen boxes of it home, I at least made the effort to upgrade my carrier to a fully-fledged shopping trolley.


### Describe the checkout

I proceed to the checkout. A teenager in tight jeans greets me. I wouldn't have even fucked her mother.

My birthday was coming up. It helped to be prepared.

## A Gun shop.

A gun shop. I'd never bought a gun before. I suppose there was no harm in




The chime of the shopkeeper's bell. Metallic refraction.





Standing behind the counter was a brattish  . The ideal career path for a former Hooter's model.

with pink ponytails.

"What can I do you for?"

"I'm looking to purchase I gun."

"Obviously. What do you need it for?"

I hesitated slightly. I think she noticed.

"What looks cooler?"

I liked the idea of a revolver.
