## Scene 1 START - Depression

### Depression Monologue

"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro-rata amidst a cheerless harmony of subversive glee, as these words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of fibre-optic lunacy and profane blather. The paraxial of thy gracious word, spectacularly contoured in a harlem of distasteful abjection, like the Dead Recurved Skunk of St. Nicholas' grave which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides the knurled quandry grasping at it's toes.

Cheeky, in an attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of nuts. Hilarious, in the laughter which ensues. The crowd applauses. The Skunk staves night for one more day and the after party is wild in it's veneration of critique. Breasts are held. Champange is saundered. The Skunk is esteemed. What a great day for comedy in this kowtow of pudicity, modest in the absurdity nibbling at your woes. Although in keeping relevant with my response, I simply yawned at the review, testament to my perception as Queen in this bizzare brute resilience of both force and sensuality.

Victorian mal-la-la-laise. Oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the faint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, dear? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the edge of your HEART so you can SATIRISE my own MALTREATMENT!?" I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef!", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another glass of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of the mind. It was a fallous attempt to withdraw my arrival from the world, and instead subside into the fabulous nooks and crannies of evaluation's eroded retreat. Cyclical cycle. Delicious tampoon. Where will you be when you lick my gloom. Et al.

### Describe Imagined Reality

"Yes, sour grapes make for a chaffy treat," I announce, as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pitter-patter scene of the Crimean rug below. Accomplice to the delicate spine which hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp cold walls supporting it's fine intrepidation into the literary foray of one's own imagination. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing going on. Something illegitimate brewing in my mind. Infected by a coarse undertone of heightened anxiety, attempting to hijack my neurons with an uncanny chatter. Musing over my follicles and leeching into my skin.

### Explain the lie

It's apparent there's trouble. A whole defeated Skunk of trouble. A vial of fear, swallowed in whole. I am fear. I am vial. Afraid of the thought and the orient. Afraid of himself. Unrecognisable in his own flesh and blood. Torn straight from a book of whimsical lies, concocted with a magical staff of lyrical deception. The words. My pen. Our lies. It sighs. Goodbye. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. I am alone. Perched upon my bed. Contorted in writhe. Blanketed by a surreal emptiness that cannot be reasoned with. Mired in a vanishing falseness. A passing moment through the vague openness of time. Maintaining it's distance with my soul. It's ever-reaching permissiveness, offering genuine refuge in a chamber of despair. "Come with me," it whispers, holding my hand like an innocent child guiding me through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all-alluring connection, pinching me with a quaint slap of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, disguised as a romantic escapade into the cannular reverberations of insufferable me, slamming into my ear and clogging my dull. Shut up and taste the jambo. Pockey huck.

### The morning struggle

I wondered to myself. Depleted in my struggle. Enthralled by the gristle of my chin, scraping against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my worldly disenchantment with the unsightly premise of enthusiasm itself. I looked up from below the covers and into the charm of my youth. 10:20am. That couldn't have been right. The yuppies are livid. Unimpressed. They chant hymns of trial and sacrifice. My death, to be celebrated post-breakfast with a rash of English bacon and sailor's bisket. My body, to be merged into society like a deftly tact of oxidised gum. A long-foregone conclusion to be approached by a 20-something-year-old cleaner on the intangible underside of a train station bench. Hard n' gunky. Friday's mistake. Another peace treaty to be clamored and adored with protective rubber gloves, and fed back into the system without a day's notice, nor care. I shake off the protruding dread with a muddy sigh, as I attempt to pull the sheets from under my body. It was no use. My arms had already become molten planks of dense reinforcement, sunk inside the gelatine goop that was my resolve. I had simply become.

### Talk about guilt

Maybe I felt guilt over the way I treated my mother, as I stood there unconstitutional in a compromised three-way of apartheid emotion. Anger, sadness and blame. All attempting to outlast my corpse in an abundant free-for-all of rape and irresistible violence. Ripping and pulling it's way through my skin and into my heart, in an unrelenting rage of Malthusian precedence. Prevailing upon my original desire to escape her abuse and live my life in reciprocal autonomy. And yet, perhaps I was the abuse I feared. The villian behind the mask. The Skunk which that hath been taught. Responsible for all the carnage I'd created in the instability and doubt I'd conjured without coupling, for the undeniable hatred which was so certain in my own mind, yet so far removed from the kind words of recoil attempting to lull me back into the calm of Mother Mary's spoilt misapprehension. Certainly, I wasn't quite sure what to believe, and perhaps I never would.

It's now 10:32am. I receive a text from the devil. A plea for forgiveness. A trigger for my aggravation. Not today. Never. In a lot of ways, my overwhelming hatred stemmed from a default state of mind which had trained itself over the millennia to baste and occur. Much like when I child throws a tantrum at the thought of doing chores, I simply wanted nothing more than to use her face as a rake to comfort the pebbles in my patio at the thought of her. Thankfully, pebbles arranged in perfect feng-shui, which I'm sure her botox-injected face wouldn't object to. My anger and sorrow, nothing more than an immediate reaction to the tumor my immune system recognised as blight, as it shoved it's precious little fingers into the bacteria of my eyes and gratified the all-consuming wrath I gathered like dust upon the earth's surface. I wasn't even sure why I hated her so much, only that I was convinced the pain and judgement that I felt was real. It was real and I was chic.

I picked myself up from my bed and made my way into the bathroom, poking the skin of my naked body in a spout of boredom. Staring at the mirror. In frail connection with the person staring back. I didn't know what compelled me to stare so deeply into my own eyes, but knew I could probably continue standing here for hours. Undiscerned in the jingoistic passage of time. Then suddenly, I felt lost. Captured in anxiety. My vision, a frivolous mess, as I stood there gasping in a shortness of breath. My stomach caving in. The vulnerability had kicked in, as broke down onto the floor in faucet of tears. The suffocation had become too overwhelming to bear, exposing what little I knew about myself and these useless hands I wore. I didn't know who I was, nor whom I wanted to be. Only that I'd give an arm and a leg to simply feel ...something. Then a spark of hope. It was time to embark on a vacation of green.

## Scene 2 START - Weed

### Describe desk

Abdula's Potato. Papier-mâché profiterole. The desk which swore. The distant protest of an Anglican coffee cup, chanting union in favour of improved recycle times. The cameo floor lamp brimming an emulsified mayonnaise-green. Dribbling it's midnight texture upon a neverending sautée of pre-classified light. The radiation of leisure across a parsley landscape of twaddled fortunes. The allure of creep. Sweet in it's starch. Pink wet toad. The dried husk of a once-thriving plant, utterly cremated. Attack. Brown. Stewing in the inaugural toxicity of it's own decay. A plume of mould. The gather of presumption, plaguing the rosewood handles of one's own foundry. Appeasing all sorts of grim. The folded stain of a raunchy men's magazine, stolen from an internet cafe in late 2006. A souless reminder of youth. Perhaps I was invalid. A crave of invalidity. An inclination of rust, pulverising my emotions into a slicken mush of private misuse. To be thrown into a tumbler and recycled for further obfuscation. Pantyhose smoke. Languid heave.

### Talk about weed usage

I safely kept my stash inside a glass-jar in the bottom-right draw of my late 18th-century desk, next to a modified Gatorade bottle which in any manner of speaking, bore the stench of a dead pirate's cunt. Stitched together with cut government piping and patched aluminium foil, the water pipe was an illegal structure which intended to mould into the hands in a bondage of duck tape and blue-collar exasperation. It was a pure object of human disgust, crafted out of the raw necessity for deep inhalation and grief-stricken appetite. A circular edge along an epaxial line. Not quite as bad, however, as the post-smoke spit container. Murderous in it's spice of greed. Over the years, the container had evolved into a plural effigy of mucus and phlegm, substantial in it's cancerous colony of malignant fondant. Growning without disclosure. Rancid in it's expanding injection of alkaline smells and vile amonia, impetuously blooming into the cerebal atmosphere of the room. I placed the glass-jar of green upon my desk, carefully arranging my papers in a conga line of hand-rolled filters and cut-piece credit cards. In perfect parallel with the green leather antique of the desk-side trims. Tight. Affectionate. I place my headphones over my ears. We're good. The weed in sieve, prudently grinded into a faithful powder with kitchen scissor hands. Frantically engaging in the reticule of spread. Glop. The rituals of the few and many.

### Describe study

The study wasn't particularly theraputic, let alone much of a study at all. It was more of a drunk phantasmagoric statement on the pride and pertinence of American exceptionalism, in full diabetic display for the senses to aggregate. In front of my desk. A flourescent orange diptych of a .45 revolver, captured in various shades of parallax aberration; the screenprint from hell. A personal affliction of misery, vomited in an electic swirl of blue, white and orange. Above me. A 1957 issue of the American flag, decorated in the nuclear caprice of some 48 administrative stars, certain in their future in the aftermath of Nazi Fortuna. Oh, how those trumpets would blare. And much like the meritocracy conspiring to put a swift end to my antics as Chief Executive Terroriser (CET), settled the prophetic right wall of the apartment building to my left. A deceptive unknowing of brick and shackled blatancy, described as "adorably exclusive" by a high-stakes property manager, whom was wearing nothing but a laminated polyester tie and a pair of wooden crocs. A maximus megaphone of billboard providence, chronically deprived of basic tenacity. The humble beginnings of my inner fiend au explorus, as I emptied the green contents of the sturdy plastic seive onto an even pocket of rolling paper, popping my kick into a sly tether of homely solipsism and dazzling my desire amongst the translucent air circumcising my efforts to breathe. I was happy. The joint was rolled. I was free.

Perhaps weed wasn't entirely necessary for my survival, although my brain certainly didn't know otherwise. As far as it was concerned, drugs were an entirely necessary extension of my existence, perhaps even compromising of my existence itself. It was the layer of reality which inflated the obscenely high levels of insular hope clouding my lungs, leaving my twill eyes in a glaze of fine China. I don't remember when I first started smoking weed, only that it was a tradition which had relegated itself to weekends, also known as the weekend grunge. First you gain sentience. Then you inhale. Then you dissipate, packing that sucker as hard as you can until your lungs collapse into a pile of honeycomb tar, and you find yourself chewing emptily on the hard excesses of dopamine for at least another week in solitude. DXM Saturdays. Prolactin's elongated title. Ultimately, I wasn't even sure why I did it. Perhaps it just made me feel cool. The feel of cool. The self-loathing of incapacitation. Who even knew. I was just another blurred line to pretend or squander. The outcome of a broken home.

### Talk about food binge.

Usually my plan post-smoke was to head out and buy as much junk as possible. You know, to really capture the sorrow and guilt of the week prior and subsidise those feelings into a bunch of equally terrible meals. And as any good technician knows, getting munted before you head out into this bold world to purchase, truly is key to making it work. Otherwise you'd probably be out saving your money for college or a premium latex-based onahole. And on this evening's menu, we're talkin' polyvinyl sticks. White-label lasagna. Cheesy cowboy stringers. Ballistic adhesive. Those fizzy fucks. All variations of sugary and salty goodness, packed and gutted into those tiny lil' tubes for your convenience, to be prepared and blasted into the spatially unaware confines of your pores so that not a single cell of your precious vital organs could possibly survive the impending failure of thy arteries, in a synaptic whiplash of nerve damage and Chrisopher Reeves. I would then proceed to purge all the food I ate from my mouth, so I could then consume more. Which soon lead to me discovering that I enjoyed the feeling of purging, far more than the actual eating. Which convinced me to eat even more, so I could then purge more often. I suppose I consoled in the fact that you always knew you were going to feel better post-purge, unlike the blatant linear ardvarkism of food. A lonely appreciation of sadness without the spike of addrenaline to keep you warm. Epicurean catharticism, dressed in an acidic bile of French good-will. I send the blessings of the Pope upon thee.

### The depression of bipolar

For a brief moment I sat there in my chair. Blank. Abandoned. The loud chorus of a German deathmarch amplifying it's methamphetamine-inspired drone through my headphones. Mindlessly engaged in the disconcerting enclosure of an empty nothingness. Determined not to think. Perhaps, unable to think at all. It was a period of calm which I hadn't experienced all day, reassured by the fact that I would most certainly be stoned come midday, and everything would be fine and dandy again. That there was some kind of plan in place I could trust, which I know wouldn't utterly fail on me or call me rude names, in a tribute to my success as a human being, which couldn't otherwise be replicated under the ordinary circumstances of my day-to-day life. In ten minutes I'd leave the apartment. Maybe sit on a bench in the park outside. Smoke my joint. Fall into a void of paranoia and self-doubt. Head to the shops. Collect the junk. Return to the apartment. Giddy in conspiracy. Pack a bowl. Smoke some more. Prepare the enslaught, and just dream of what it might have been like if I just received a few more hugs growing up. That's what I wanted to happen. To paint a complete picture of my scars without the tarnish of bullshit to prevent me from evolving into the nourishment of tissue which had become my face. The wholesome without the father. Profit's wallace grim. I rose up out of my chair and headed for the door, plenary in this chamber of partite inequality. Not quite so determined to contend with the putty of pineal distress in the form of my tears, which clearly indicated that I was nothing more than a walking disaster, unable to insinuate how incredibly useless I truly was.

## Scene 3 START - Neighbour

-->

Thirty-fuck. The trixie air slams it's hairy coon into the back of my neck. Needlessly travelling across my cheek in a fastidious rain of filched indiscriminate. Season's greetings, you cunt. Streaks of lightning jilt n' tither across my jaw, throwing it's twirl into a pirouette rotation of cross-examination. Index and middle fingers enter my mouth. Gaudy shore. Suckling the impressionable membrame of my gum. A protruding lump. Mullion vomit. The ruse of a deadbeat mensch.

I was cold. The air was fresh, and I was cold. Too cold for the flimsy balcony supporting the expanding curfew of lines departing from my torso. A feet and a foot. The forbode of a commission housing nightmare, trickling with the sweet awe of exodus. Gravid poverty's expect. A concrete tell-tale of Dicken's cinder block and 80s' fanfare, siphoning leverage from the hundreds of burdensome souls preoccupying the locality of this apartment block. Crawling pebble walls covered in pig's brine. The stench of a generation. My breath smelt like shit, and I was going to show it. Joint in hand. Ready to roll. I picture my favourite porn star wearing a U.S.A. themed bikini outfit. Sprayed with fake tan. Drenched with oil. Parading her fake tits like a deranged rapist. Keep it classy, cumberbatch. Penthouse defile.

### Woman appears / Describe neighbourhood

A woman appears from the staircase, carrying what seems to be a large stack of boxes. Yet I could not identify her. I assumed she lived on this floor, so how had I not judged or sized her before? At the end of the hall was the DND nerd, whom both simultaneously looked and smelt as if he'd both showered every single day, and had never showered a single day at all in his life. A staple income for the rug n' tug a few blocks down. Was that seventy with mouth, or am I also expected to grant a visa to your poor cousin as well? Next to him was the woman in the turquoise mini-van. A scathing lump of intrepid witchery. A face mask for the ugly and poor. Not old enough to be retired, not pretty enough to be a cam girl, yet was always turtled at home. Scheming. Possibly braiding the outskirts of her vagina with a hot iron, in a gesture of guilt for the way life treated her. Those certainly weren't designer lips.

### Describe woman

The first thing I noticed was the silky black texture of her skin. Worn without crown, delegating the rapier luminosity of elegance she clearly held without noticing, which simply flowed from her long curly hair and down to her hips. I was mesmerised. I wanted more. I had become corrupt. She stumbled towards me in an exhaled gaff of sweat, in her collossal attempt to haul this thing up 16 flights of stairs. Placing the boxes down on the ground in complete exhaustion, revealing the rest of her face and body. She was gorgeous, and I was me. I suppose the least I could was flirt with her, especially now that she was at her weakest.

"Hey, do you need hand with that? I'm just from down the hall," I offered, sounding barely genuine in my stoned hunger. Clearly offering more than just a rag of sincere physical extrapolation. I mean, I was wearing stained track pants for god's sake. I was either a hermit or a paedophile. Possibly both.

"Yeah, sure! That would be great, thank you. I just need it in through here." I loved the striking confidence in her voice. The way it knew what it wanted, without demanding anything from you. I loved the way her mouth hovered over her words, like a lallygag of harmless spiders pouring from a punctured sac of extradition. Tickling their prey into a folly of submission. It was a bright arpeggio of inspired direction. The one thing I was sorely needing in life. She opens her scratched-up apartment door, conveniently inbetween to the incessant string fiddler and the hawk-eyed pickler, two of my of least-liked tennants. I'm pretty sure they both liked to scissor, like a pack of squirmy love-hens. A bloody waste, I say.

### Enter her apartment

The door swung open and a whole new world revealed itself to the mainstay discoure of my mind. Projector's everywhere. Screens of all different kinds. A litter of topography upon the foundations of her apartment. Vintage devices from the earliest of industrialisation. Cathode Ray Tubes of antiqued design. Bundled in crate's of two near a flourishing African blood lily in the corner of the room, spittig it's frazzled pollen onto a litter of large aperature lens, teaming with dust. She was a classy hoarder, if ever you could describe such a thing.

"Oh, so I see you like screens?", I remarked, taken aback by the museum of historic memorabillia ingesting my vision.

"Yeah, it's become a bit of an obsession of mine. I'm a bit of a cinema archivist, if I don't say myself." She ended her sentence with a bright up-ticket in her word. I couldn't tell if she was in denial, or if she was open about her disorder, although either way the sex was going to be great. A splay of horrific restlessness as I dug my fingers deep into her skin, as I fucked her in vehement arousal, shoving my foot in her asshole and hearing her scream. I really needed to pull it together, but it was hard with my mind where it was. I placed the large box down next to the couch, pretending as if I just didn't slightly pull my hamstring and everything was just fine.

"Would you like something to drink?" Yes. Yes, I would.

### Chat on the couch

We both sat on the couch and began chatting casually about our lives. The struggles. The nuances. The stupid neighbours next door. What we loved and abhorred. She felt both real and exciting. More than just a tack on the wall. A woman with intelligence and character. Who made me feel more than just another card to be played. The whiteness of her teeth. Her oversized prescription glasses. Part of me couldn't stop noticing the iridescence of her eyes, contrast against the scintillating blackness of her face. It was like staring at the nebulous surface of an unfinished cup of coffee, swirling in tandem against the chocolately surface of the aromatic blend. I think she liked me. Apparently if a girl looks at your lips three times it means she wants to kiss you, and I was certain that she wanted my tongue. Of course, we were neighbours and I was about as self-assured as a wet sock. But at least I was honest with myself.

"Oh, so you're a writer. That's super cool! I wish I could write, but I don't seem to be good at anything. Although I have a lot of knowledge about film." She turns her body towards my direction, parlous in the docile nature of her proportionate body.

I receive a text. "I look forward to tonight xoxo". My temperature rose. Shit. Tonight's date with Milo. I'd completely forgot, or perhaps repressed, my scheduled escort with the devil. I suppose I couldn't have both women cavort my lap, rubbing my pre-cum into the flouncing creases of my pants.

"Anyway, it was nice to meet you, but I better to head off," I noted, concerned whether I was even going to make it to her apartment on time. It was already 5pm and I had no idea how to get there, let alone decide what I was going to wear. Maybe she preferred the drug-fucked look of a man covered in the scent of a poorly received six-pack, now wreaking havoc with the odour of his shirt some many weeks later.

"Thanks for your help. It was really kind of you. Feel free to pop round, maybe we could watch a movie together?"

"Yes. I would love that." I wasn't sure if what I said came across as being needy, however it was genuinely how I felt. An overwhelming sense of warmth and connection, which transcended well-beyond her thorough intelligence and marvelous attraction. It was a sense of connection that I'd never felt before. She was the one that I wanted to be with. Of course, as per usual, I wasn't sure if I'd simply become delusional

She walked me out to the front, waving with a smitten smile attached to her face, as I left her apartment in a giddy of infatuation. Maria was her name. As beautiful as beauty could be.

I receive another text from Milo. This time an image. Transparent red lace. Trim embellish. Pure white skin. An exercise of pre-cum on this Sunday afternoon.
