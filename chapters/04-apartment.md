## Scene 1 START - Depression

### Depression Monologue
<!--
"Moderately entertaining." Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro-rata amidst a cheerless harmony of subversive glee, as these words drag themselves miserably along a serrated tarmac of circular needles and profane blather. The paraxial of thy gracious word, spectacularly contoured in a harlem of distasteful abjection, like the Dead Recurved Skunk of St. Nicholas' grave which lies on it's belly in the tall notched grass besides the knurled quandry grasping at it's toes.

Cheeky, in an attempt to tell a misplaced joke about the inequality of nuts. Hilarious, in the laughter which ensues. The crowd applauses. The Skunk staves night for one more day and the after party is wild in it's veneration of critique. Breasts are held. Champange is saundered. The Skunk is esteemed. What a great day for comedy in this kowtow of pudicity, modest in the absurdity nibbling at your woes. Although in keeping relevant with my response, I simply yawned at the review, testament to my perception as Queen in this bizzare brute resilience of both force and sensuality.

Victorian mal-la-la-laise. Oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the faint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, dear? Can you feel it grasp at your pain? Do you need it slightly closer to the edge of your HEART so you can SATIRISE your own MALTREATMENT!?" I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries being thrown my way, unrecoverable in the thick unease permeating through my velvet angular plea. "My compliments to the chef!", I thought rather aimlessly, as I poured myself another glass of wine, confining myself to the tight pre-occupied spaces of the mind. A fallous attempt to withdraw my arrival from the world, and instead subside into the fabulous nooks and crannies of evaluation's eroded retreat. Cyclical cycle. Delicious tampoon. Where will you be when you lick my gloom. Et al.

### Describe Imagined Reality

"Yes, sour grapes make for a chaffy treat," I announce, as the tip of my nose comes in close contact with the vast sea of wine in my glass, tipping ever-so slightly onto the pitter-patter scene of the Crimean rug below. Accomplice to the delicate spine which hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the damp cold walls supporting it's fine intrepidation into the literary foray of one's own imagination. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. There's something disturbing going on. Something illegitimate brewing in my mind. Infected by a coarse undertone of heightened anxiety, attempting to hijack my neurons with an uncanny chatter. Musing over my follicles and leeching into my skin.

### Explain the lie

It's apparent there's trouble. A whole defeated Skunk of trouble. A vial of fear, swallowed in whole. I am fear. I am vial. Afraid of the thought and the orient. Afraid of himself. Unrecognisable in his own flesh and blood. Torn straight from a book of whimsical lies, concocted with a magical staff of lyrical deception. The words. My pen. Our lies. It sighs. Goodbye. The glass is not real. The wine cannot be located. The desk has no form. I am alone. Perched upon my bed. Contorted in writhe. Blanketed by a surreal emptiness that cannot be reasoned with. Mired in a vanishing falseness. A passing moment through the vague openness of time. Maintaining it's distance with my soul. It's ever-reaching permissiveness, offering genuine refuge in a chamber of despair. "Come with me," it whispers, holding my hand like an innocent child guiding me through a magical forest of fairies and otma. "I promise I don't bite." It's all-alluring connection, pinching me with a quaint slap of tactile aversion. A poor vulgarization of petty self-love, disguised as a romantic escapade into the cannular reverberations of insufferable me, slamming into my ear and clogging my dull. Shut up and taste the jambo. Pockey huck.

### The morning struggle

I wondered to myself. Depleted in my struggle. Enthralled by the gristle of my chin, scraping against the crumpled linen sheets shrouding the glob of human sinew supporting my worldly disenchantment with the unsightly premise of enthusiasm itself. I look up from the below the covers and into the charm of my youth. 10:20am. That couldn't have been good for the kidneys. The yupies are unimpressed. They chant hymns of sacrifice. My death, to be celebrated post-breakfast with a rash of English bacon and sailor's bisket. My body, to be merged into society like the long-foregone conclusion of oxidised gum, to be discovered and approached by a 20-something-year-old cleaner on the intangible underside of a train station bench. Hard n' gunky. Another peace treaty to be clamored and adored with protective rubber gloves, and fed back into the system without a day's notice, nor care. I shake off the protruding dread with a muddy sigh, as I attempt to pull the sheets from under my body. It was no use. My arms had already become molten planks of dense reinforcement, sunk inside the gelatine goop that was my resolve. I had simply become.

### Talk about guilt

Maybe I felt guilt over the way I treated my mother, as I stood there unconstitutional in a compromised three-way of apartheid emotion. Anger, sadness and blame. All attempting to pick my corpse in an abundant free-for-all of rape and violence. Ripping and pulling it's way into my heart in an unrelenting rage of Malthusian precedence, long outlasting my original desire to escape her abuse and live my life free. And yet, perhaps I was the abuse I feared. The villian behind the mask, responsible for all the carnage I'd created in the instability and doubt I'd conjured. Responsible for the hatred which was so certain in my own mind, yet so far removed from the kind words of recoil attempting to lull me back into a state of calm. Certainly, I wasn't quite sure what to believe, only that I simply didn't have the energy to compute what little posture I'd hoped to maintain.

It's now 10:32am. I receive a text from the devil. A plea for forgiveness. A trigger for my aggravation. Not today. Never. In a lot of ways, my overwhelming hatred stemmed from a default state of mind which had trained itself over millennia to baste and occur. Much like when I child throws a tantrum at the thought of completing homework, I simply wanted nothing more than to use her face as a rake to comfort the rocks in my patio. Thankfully, rocks arranged in perfect feng-shui, which I'm sure she wouldn't object to. My anger and sorrow, nothing more than an immediate reaction to the tumor I recognised as blight, as it shoved it's precious little fingers into my eyes and gratified the all-consuming wrath I gathered like dust upon the earth's surface. I wasn't even sure why I hated my mother so much, only that I was convinced the pain and judgement that I felt was real.

I picked myself up from my bed and made my way into the bathroom, poking the skin of my naked body in a spout of boredom. Staring at the mirror. Gasping in a shortness of breath. Slowly breaking done into a flood of tears, as the suffocation becomes too overwhelming to bear. Exposing what little I knew about myself. Fathering in overlapping patterns of hot violet, bringing my body to the floor. I didn't know who I was, nor whom I wanted to be. Only that the textile green of cannabis made everything better again. The universal craving without a suitable name. Yeah. That's what I needed. Another reason to vacate.

## Scene 2 START - Weed

### Describe desk

Abdula's Potato. Papier-mâché profiterole. The desk which swore. The distant protest of an Anglican coffee cup, chanting union in favour of improved recycle times. The cameo lamp of floor. Brimming an emulsified mayonnaise-green, dribbling it's midnight texture upon a neverending sautée of light. Radiating across a parsley landscape of twaddled fortunes. The allure of creep. Sweet in it's starch. The dried husk of a once-thriving plant, utterly cremated. Brown. Stewing in the inaugural toxicity of it's own decay. A plume of mould. The gather of presumption, plaguing the desk's wooden handles. Appeasing all sorts of grim. The folded stain of a raunchy men's magazine, stolen from an internet cafe in 2006. A souless reminder of youth. Perhaps I simply wanted to feel invalid. To feel my emotions pulverised into mush, recycled and thrown into a tumbler for further obfuscation. Pantyhose smoke. Languid heave.

### Talk about weed usage

I safely kept my stash inside a glass-jar next to a modified Gatorade bottle, parked in the bottom-right draw of my desk. Stitched together with cut government piping and patched aluminium foil, it was an illegal structure of duck tape and melted plastic. A circular edge along an epaxial line. A thing of disgust. Crafted out of human necessity and a desire for smoke. I placed the jar upon my desk, carefully arranging my papers along a conga line of hand-rolled filters and cut credit cards. Perfectly parallel with the green leather of my antique desk. I put my headphones on and I begin to grind the weed, utilising a plastic sieve and a pair of kitchen scissors. The rituals of the few and many.

### Describe study

The study wasn't a particularly theraputic room. In front of my desk hung a diptych screenprint of an flourescent orange revolver, captured in various shades of parallax aberration. A personal affliction of distaste, vomitted in an electic swirl of green, white and orange. Above me hung a 1957 issue of the American flag, 48 stars, certain in their future in the depths of white, red and blue. The window besides me faced the opposing wall of a separate apartment building. A display of brick explained as "exclusive" by a former property manager, now perusing

I could feel the touch of my inner fiend jump inside my body, as I rolled the joint with a sly in my kick. Another blurred line to pretend or squander. Prolactin's elongated title. Profit's wallace grim. Ultimately, I wasn't even sure why I did it. Perhaps it just made me feel cool. The self-loathing of incapacitation. The return of my

Perhaps weed wasn't entirely necessary for my survival, although my brain certainly didn't know any better. As far as it was concerned, drugs were an entirely necessary extension of my existence, perhaps even compromising of my existence itself. Inflating the insular hope which clouded my lungs and left me in a glaze of fine China. I don't remember when I first started smoking weed, only that it was a tradition which had relegated itself to weekends. First you gain sentience. Then you inhale. Then you disperse, packing the sucker as hard as you can until your lungs collapse and you find yourself chewing on the hard excess of dopamine for weeks on end.

### Talk about food binge.

Usually my plan was to buy as much junk as possible from the supermarket. We're talkin' polyvinyl sticks. White-label lasagna. Cheesy cowboy stringers. Ballistic adhesive. Those fizzy fucks. All variations of sugary goodness, to be packed into tight tubes for convenience, and blasted into the confines of my pores so that not a single cell of my vital organs would survive the impending failure of my arteries in a synaptic whiplash of nerve damage. I would then proceed to purge so I could consume more. I soon discovered and approached that I would enjoy the feeling of purging more than I did eating, which lead me to eat even more, so I could purge more often. I suppose I consoled in the fact that you always knew you were going to feel better post-purge. Epicurean catharticism, dressed in an acidic bile of good-will. The blessings of the pope upon thee.

### The depression of bipolar

For a moment I sat there at my desk, music playing in my ears. Caught in a mindless gaze of nothingness. It was a period of calm which I hadn't experienced all day, knowing that I would be stoned come midday. I'd leave the apartment. Maybe sit the grass of the park outside. Light up my joint. Fall into the void. Return to the apartment, giddy in a . I'd make myself a bowl of homecooked noodles,

Deep down inside I knew what I wanted, and it wasn't a pretty picture. What I really wanted was a craze. To feel completely.

I rose up out of my chair and headed for the door. A putty of pineal hormones, not quite so determined to seek plenary assembly in this chamber of partite inequality.

## Scene 3 START - Neighbour

Thirty-fuck. The trixie air slams it's hairy coon into the back of my neck. Needlessly travelling across my cheek in a fastidious rain of filched indiscriminate. Season's greetings, you cunt. Streaks of lightning jilt n' tither across my jaw, throwing it's twirl into a pirouette rotation of cross-examination. Index and middle fingers enter my mouth. Suckling the impressionable membrame of my gum. A protruding lump. Mullion vomit. The ruse of a deadbeat mensch.

I was cold. The air was fresh, and I was cold. Too cold for the flimsy balcony supporting the expanding curfew of lines departing from my torso. A feet and a foot. The forbode of a commission housing nightmare, trickling with the sweet awe of exodus. Gravid poverty's expect. A concrete tell-tale of Dicken's brick and 80s' fanfare, siphoning leverage from the hundreds of burdensome souls preoccupying the locality of this apartment block. Crawling pebble walls covered in pig's brine. The stench of a generation. My breath smelt like shit, and I was going to show it. Joint in hand. Ready to roll. I picture my favourite porn star wearing a U.S.A. themed bikini outfit. Sprayed with fake tan. Drenched with oil. Parading her fake tits like a deranged rapist. Keep it classy, cumberbatch. Penthouse defile.

### Woman appears / Describe neighbourhood

A woman appears from the staircase, carrying what seems to be a large stack of boxes. Yet I could not identify her. I assumed she lived on this floor, so how had I not judged or sized her before? At the end of the hall was the DND nerd, whom both simultaneously looked and smelt as if he'd both showered every single day, and had never showered a single day at all in his life. A staple income for the rug n' tug a few blocks down. Was that seventy with mouth, or am I also expected to grant a visa to your poor cousin as well? Next to him was the woman in the turquoise mini-van. A scathing lump of intrepid witchery. A face mask for the ugly and poor. Not old enough to be retired, not pretty enough to be a cam girl, yet was always turtled at home. Scheming. Possibly braiding the outskirts of her vagina with a hot iron, in a gesture of guilt for the way life treated her. Those certainly weren't designer lips.

### Describe woman

The first thing I noticed was the silky black texture of her skin. Worn without crown, delegating the rapier luminosity of elegance she clearly held without noticing, which simply flowed from her long curly hair and down to her hips. I was mesmerised. I wanted more. I had become corrupt. She stumbled towards me in an exhaled gaff of sweat, in her collossal attempt to haul this thing up 16 flights of stairs. Placing the boxes down on the ground in complete exhaustion, revealing the rest of her face and body. She was gorgeous, and I was me. I suppose the least I could was flirt with her, especially now that she was at her weakest.

"Hey, do you need hand with that? I'm just from down the hall," I offered, sounding barely genuine in my stoned hunger. Clearly offering more than just a rag of sincere physical extrapolation. I mean, I was wearing stained track pants for god's sake. I was either a hermit or a pedophile. Possibly both.

"Yeah, sure! That would be great, thank you. I just need it in through here." I loved the striking confidence in her voice. The way it knew what it wanted, without demanding anything from you. I loved the way her mouth hovered over her words, like a lallygag of harmless spiders pouring from a punctured sac of extradition. Tickling their prey into a folly of submission. It was a bright arpeggio of inspired direction. The one thing I was sorely needing in life. She opens her scratched-up apartment door, conveniently inbetween to the incessant string fiddler and the hawk-eyed pickler, two of my of least-liked tennants. I'm pretty sure they both liked to scissor, like a pack of squirmy love-hens. A bloody waste, I say.

### Enter her apartment

The door swung open and a whole new world revealed itself to the mainstay discoure of my mind. Projector's everywhere. Screens of all different kinds. A litter of topography upon the foundations of her apartment. Vintage devices from the earliest of industrialisation. Cathode Ray Tubes of antiqued design. Bundled in crate's of two near a flourishing African blood lily in the corner of the room, spittig it's frazzled pollen onto a litter of large aperature lens, teaming with dust. She was a classy hoarder, if ever you could describe such a thing.

"Oh, so I see you like screens?", I remarked, taken aback by the museum of historic memorabillia ingesting my vision.

"Yeah, it's become a bit of an obsession of mine. I'm a bit of a cinema archivist, if I don't say myself." She ended her sentence with a bright up-ticket in her word. I couldn't tell if she was in denial, or if she was open about her disorder, although either way the sex was going to be great. A splay of horrific restlessness as I dug my fingers deep into her skin, as I fucked her in vehement arousal, shoving my foot in her asshole and hearing her scream. I really needed to pull it together, but it was hard with my mind where it was. I placed the large box down next to the couch, pretending as if I just didn't slightly pull my hamstring and everything was just fine.

"Would you like something to drink?" Yes. Yes, I would.

### Chat on the couch

We both sat on the couch and began chatting casually about our lives. The struggles. The nuances. The stupid neighbours next door. What we loved and abhorred. She felt both real and exciting. More than just a tack on the wall. A woman with intelligence and character. Who made me feel more than just another card to be played. The whiteness of her teeth. Her oversized prescription glasses. Part of me couldn't stop noticing the iridescence of her eyes, contrast against the scintillating blackness of her face. It was like staring at the nebulous surface of an unfinished cup of coffee, swirling in tandem against the chocolately surface of the aromatic blend. I think she liked me. Apparently if a girl looks at your lips three times it means she wants to kiss you, and I was certain that she wanted my tongue. Of course, we were neighbours and I was about as self-assured as a wet sock. But at least I was honest with myself.

"Oh, so you're a writer. That's super cool! I wish I could write, but I don't seem to be good at anything. Although I have a lot of knowledge about film." She turns her body towards my direction, parlous in the docile nature of her proportionate body.

I receive a text. "I look forward to tonight xoxo". My temperature rose. Shit. Tonight's date with Milo. I'd completely forgot, or perhaps repressed, my scheduled escort with the devil. I suppose I couldn't have both women cavort my lap, rubbing my pre-cum into the flouncing creases of my pants.

"Anyway, it was nice to meet you, but I better to head off," I noted, concerned whether I was even going to make it to her apartment on time. It was already 5pm and I had no idea how to get there, let alone decide what I was going to wear. Maybe she preferred the drug-fucked look of a man covered in the scent of a poorly received six-pack, now wreaking havoc with the odour of his shirt some many weeks later.

"Thanks for your help. It was really kind of you. Feel free to pop round, maybe we could watch a movie together?"

"Yes. I would love that." I wasn't sure if what I said came across as being needy, however it was genuinely how I felt. An overwhelming sense of warmth and connection, which transcended well-beyond her thorough intelligence and marvelous attraction. It was a sense of connection that I'd never felt before. She was the one that I wanted to be with. Of course, as per usual, I wasn't sure if I'd simply become delusional

She walked me out to the front, waving with a smitten smile attached to her face, as I left her apartment in a giddy of infatuation. Maria was her name. As beautiful as beauty could be.

I recieve another text from Milo. This time an image. Transparent red lace. Trim embellish. Pure white skin. An exercise of pre-cum on this Sunday afternoon.
