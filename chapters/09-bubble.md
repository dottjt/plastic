## Scene 1 START

### Opening Monologue

It was any ordinary day. The sun continued its glorious expansion into our extinction. Its trees basked in the overflowing radiation emanating from its magnificent sky, seemingly weary of its sudden encounter with consciousness. Providing light to all of the world, inspiring children across the Middle East to strap high-impact explosives to their chests in a faithful martyr of Muhammad theatre. Their magical prophet. The harbinger of hymn. Creator of sun, and bringeth of thy BOOM BOOM. While the rest of the world remained ever-more ignorant of the internal politics of foreign occupation. The President sighs with a mojito in hand. End scene.

"Fight a war, win a war," announces a young U.S. Marshall in immaculate serviceman attire, as he paces the outskirts of a halal-certified brothel south of the Kuwait border. The fear is real in his mind; the mind of this 98' NFL draft hopeful. Plagued by the contrived fantasies of rape and gore he wished to impose upon these working-class women; driven mad by the blood he drew from their now-deceased husbands. Converted by the bullets of his Christian descent. Basked in the sand of Allah's praise. With a gun in one hand and a bible in the other, the professional soldier storms the building with a loud BANG. Pinning down a young woman. Screaming. Plunging his battle-hardened penis into her petit figure, biting and tearing her burka in two. Ripping through the tight walls of her weakened vagina in a devouring ache, as her mouth proceeded to pulpitate in a gazeless stare of trauma. The soft outline of her body, now flaccid in a faint tremor of unquestionable incomprehension. Utterly mute in a trance of inarticulate shock. The man smothers his bible over her face. Suffocating her. Addressing her sin. Before climaxing inside her stricken body in an explosion of cum. Kissing her on her pale lips in a bid to help her forget the pain. Ending her misery with a glock to the brain.

### Back on the Train

"That was quite overt," I thought to myself. As I took a moment to pause and think about the fundamental implications of my imagination. Backdrop against a dyslexic array of miniature-sized dwellings, littering the zeitgeist of my train ride into work this morning. "...aaaand as we enter our pods, secure in a tunnel-vision of pre-determined repetition. It's super important that we remember to gloat at the shit-giggler. That coveted man promised to be our only hope once the virus hits. So don't forget to gloat, kids!" I knew I should have stopped writing year's ago. My mind, abuzz with all sorts of fantastical whims and jarring phrases. Designed to fright n' excite, like a pickled jar of boiled cantaloupe. Pour me, baby. Pour me lard. Oh dear. And my hair was a mess. It was a dangled mop of yearning disarray, in desperate need of style and attention. Although part of me liked the emo gradle, constituent to my overall look as a disenfranchised loner with an infatuation for animated breasts. Another day, another dawn. We rest our souls in this flashy marginalisation of peace, fervour to the extreme exuberance which rolls over your eyes. Then in an ecstatic rush of temporal ammonia, I transfer my mind over to my hands. Trampled in the yawn of a late-night regret. Stepping off the train and onto the newly-renovated platform, into a compound enclosure of career psychopaths and keyboard warriors. As a lone gunman stands on top of a vending machine, armed with a toothpick and a salience of rum. Ready to drown solace in its rightful place on the over-worked floor of a shopping-mall McDonalds. All for an inoffensive staff discount for all meals after 10pm. How dame.

### Describe Stock Market Crash

Of course, truth was that today was hardly ordinary. Although stuck in their ordinary ways, the population had unanimously descended into a castellation of worry. In its reluctance for hyperbolic discernment. In its aversion for eye-contact. In its remarkably ambivalent choices of sub-station coffee, weighing borderline-unhuman on a spectrum of caffè-latte injustice. Dastardly. As citizens and scoundrel alike, stood mesmerised at their phones. Glued to their screens in a stream of digital intrigue. Leering across their faces in a fiery cliff of red. The stock market had crashed and everyone was afraid. Collective in their hive minds of jitter and fear. Mindless in their consumption of pre-teen alcohol. Even the homeless were in an abundance of maul. Soaked weary in their bedraggled cardboard huts and sooty tin sheds, as they counted down their last remaining scraps and munitions, to the trail of a picant restlessness. The source of their drove. Perhaps even I was beginning to lose my mind, as I continued my tread along the figures and rows towards my battlestation. A few blocks down from the epicentre of the collapse. The house of wires. A touch of Brunei. Hollow in the presentiment that was sure to come.

### Arriving at Office

From the station to my stride, there was a keen sense of dread that lingered over the never-ending déjà vu of countless cogs, marching in pairs of two into the office building that morning. The pound of their flesh, steadying their forward-mass into the beginnings of an unapproachable glide. Forcing their woes into a cargo motion of dappled euphoria, as they placed one foot in front of the other. Drunken in a pyre of forlorn depression. Conspiring against fate in a messy battle-royale of blame and conjecture. As they cried and mourned over the erroneous failures of a hierarchical few, making itself evident in the financial consequences of a deep grim. The cogs were a mess. It was like peering into the sauntered graveyard of a demotional pew. Dark in its legionarius clouds. Glory in its indemnity. Held sacred upon a millennia of cask and bone, as the overwhelming coldness of the lobby captured me whole. In search of being. For the bread which creaked. Shriek amongst the bounty of lost souls which levitated in a disturbed tremor. Whirr above our heads. Awaiting their burial at the end of their desks.

I throw a smile at the receptionist. The usual happy-hour of the moment. She returns my request with a stark glare. Putrid in its bitterness. Montane in its stare. As if I'd just maimed her cat with a thin piece of chicken wire, dumping its sopping corpse in front of her. Wearing it's personalised cat collar in a humid tarry of meddled distaste. Gone were the vibrant colours and buoyant pick-me-ups. Those things which made her mainstay. The electra of her heart. The beauty of her way. In were the bleak browns. The sickening whites. The pulmonate shells. Matched against an ice-cold block of Carbon lipstick and expired sanitiser. Lumpy in it's squirt. Diageo like a lap dance at a Jewish funeral; grunge in it's lousy lude malaise. I continued to walk through the lobby and into the office. Veiled in silence. The portraits were gone. Thrown in a pile and burnt for warmth, as a blue-back hissed towards my direction. Afraid of the unknown. Thankfully the kitchen hadn't changed all that much, although I couldn't possibly have understood how it could have degraded any further. In fact, I think it had almost improved in some unbeknownst way. Even the office manager was shocked, as she inspected the outstanding lack of grime on the kitchen-top counter. A fascination for us all.

Unlike the kitchen however, the rest of the office had completely reduced itself into a satisfaction of erratic self-reliance and equatorial unrest. Born from a dystopian savagery which bore into the thick peptone of our heads, and created what seemed like an asylum of misguided self-gurus. Junior developers could be witnessed pacing back and forth in between their workstations, coddled in an anxiety of austere Bluetooth mouth. The technological hysteria of a gaping moron. Marketing co-ordinators and copywriters alike, in the dozens, tying nooses and makeshift scythes out of rejected board-meeting catch phrases, plain in th e throughfare of dismal hype lending itself to this very disaster. Lowly interns grabbing imaginary cups of coffee from imaginary vendors, terrified in a role play of psychological truce.

### Milo Interaction

The only person who didn't quite seem so dejected was Milo.

"Hello stranger. Looks like someone decided to rock up to work today. I didn't know you liked me that much."

I wanted to cry. She acted normal, as if nothing had happened between us. 

"Sure."

"A candy confectionary company for human pets", states the first h1 element of our serverless website, hand-crafted in pure HTML by some orange-back.

"What's up with everyone? It seems a bit tense out there. You didn't attack some poor girl in the toilets again, did you?"

"Oh, you know me. I would never allow a witness escape. No, didn't you hear about the stock market? It's pretty brutal."

Yet something had caught her by surprise. Shock. Horror. Delore. In the fade distance, chirping in a distinctive waddle of daphnia and jellied sand, was a man the office had witnessed in months. Dressed casual in a Tahitian blind, peppered to the brim in subtropic flowers and exotic motifs. It was a bit like watching an air travel billboard approach you without warning, alas to everyone's surprise. The boss was in the office for the first time in months. The chastity had become agonising. God had arrived.

### In work we trust

"In work we trust," preaches an overly-caffeinated woman sitting on-top of a repurposed milk crate, lactating uncontrollably through the red and white stripes of her luminous blouse. Veins firmly attached to the outer-rims of the patriarchy's pyrex mesh of pampered silence. "It's called leverage, silly", she claims in a jolly burst of hysteric miasma, as she points her finger towards the sky with a know-it-all grin. Mid-podcast, she turns her attention towards her computer screen, avidly licking her lips in an orgasmic laughter of despair, as she sensually contorts the crippling RSI in her hands, eyes caught in a casual dally with the company's Kanban Board of Innovation. Featuring an extensive spreadsheet of her most favourable physical attributes, it was the perfect checklist for the aspiring career-focused woman. Bloated Lips. Check. Fake Detachable Eyelashes. Check. Inflatable Silicone Breasts. Check. Bleached Pink Vagina? Still stuck in the Todo column, I see?

Ah well, that's a real shame and it might even cost her this year's promotion, however it's supple hastings here on the Mystery Mysogony Hour, as we invite everyone's favourite project manager to instigate this awful discrepancy. Well, it's official folks. The reports are in and unfortunately she's been an utter cunt of a "filthy bitch whore", prompting our beloved senior jockey to knock her out with his laptop stand and grope her massive breasts gushing with milky coalesce. He will then proceed to drag her limp body into a secure meeting room to be disfigured and raped, in swift preparation for an unidentifiable plethora of executive cock and caviar-littered cum. Involving at least half the sales floor and a freshly-picked intern trained purely in the art of gymnastic, it looks like we could be in for a real doozy, folks!

Men and children alike grab sections of her bruised body as it's dragged by in harmonious ceremony. "Take this poor women and guide her towards the top of patriarchy!", gleams an autistic man in an over-sized company sweater, gaff in a choking fit of insoluable lubricant following a sincere attempt to deep-throat a hard-drive full of high-resolution images of the CEO's junk. Unfortunately, it just ain't the same for ol' dick-weed here, what with his pronounced adam's apple and crippling inability to imitate a Disney-inspired blow-job. Fortunately however, eligible for his underage daughter who's just returned from rehab, proudly completing her 3rd stint in an all-inclusive five-star resort for anorexic over-achievers, following an unfortunate incident with a c-level executive and their new 'back-door' policy. Although I must admit, there's nothing quite like a carpal tunnel induced hand-job at three-to-ten in the afternoon, following an hour-long lecture on the cautionary reprimand of sexual harassment within the workplace. The status quo was here to stay.

### Describe Boss

"Well, well. If it isn't the shit-meister," gloats the 6-foot mirage of coconut-butter and Machiavellian breath, amok in an eschew of Piña colada inspired hand signals. While he certainly wasn't the prettiest man, what with the raw gizzard and touching cellulite which dribbled from his chin, there was a lot to say about the sigh of comic relief which was his contribution towards the company. A title wedged so high on a pedestal so far away in the heavens above, that not even his own arrogance could pertain to the barrage of sanity attempting to bring him back down from such dizzying heights. He was the dad that allowed you to set mummy's new curtains on fire, if only so you'd shut up and bless him another 10 minutes of silence to watch the game in peace.

"What wonderful eyes you have, sir. It really is a delight to have you back in the office."

"Shut up, pansy. Now listen here kids. I've got some big news for you all, and you ain't gonna like it. This place is fallin' to shit and we're going to have to make some changes around ere'." Although everyone was seemingly aware of the financial strife that the company was going through, it was still business as usual round these parts of town. Largely, people lounged around and dwadled on their screens, sending each other memes and . At one point I'm pretty sure I even saw someone enstated a cardboard cutout.

### Pulled into the bosses' office

The room was so small you'd thought you were inside a miniature doll-sized simulation.
