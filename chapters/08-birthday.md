### Birthday Monologue

A week of life passes by. The rain runs thin. My hair is dry. The work is dull. Today is my birthday. The loneliest day of the year. An empty echo-chamber of must-haves and has-beens, drowning in a desperate plea for love n' attention. Slurry in my deficit for lace n' affection, as I wear the hearty embrace of a fuck-off grin upon the impression of my chin. I often wondered what a birthday was, beyond a fine-grained permission to feel bad about one's existence. At most it tasted like a cookie from childhood, dipped in pity and crumbled upon the palm of your hands. For ol' time's sake. Just to prove that you hadn't yet been raped and tortured by some Taliban rookie in a silk robe, hungry to supply the American's with an ever-growing quantity of pure Afghani Opium. His glutinous fingers, a constant threat for your safety. You fear the black tar.


It's 10:35am. I receive a text from my mother. That bitch. That fatal fucking bitch. It supplies me with a trove a emotions which swirl in tandem around me. Throwing my emotions into a whirlwind of fervent aggression. Anger. Predominantly I felt anger. The kind of anger which evolved into a catastrophic

I block her.

Hoping to disperse its lovely little claws into your spread, violating what little aspiration you have to weed your way back to safety. At first it shrieks in a mad outburst, indicating its own displeasure with the world. Then it withers into a cloud of mould to suffocate any amount of apprehension from gaining necessary foothold. Lastly it smothers in absolute quantity, absorbing scar tissue and trauma at an incomprehensible rate. And once it's all over, in the snap of a heartbeat, it was as if nothing remained at all. A desolate fire of dementia, swept clean in an enticing devastation of brilliance.


### Attempted Suicide

Saturday morning. Sunday autopsy. Duck-taped to the underside of my desk, I vainly attempt to rip the pistol from the fragmented clumps of dust underlying the trigger, pointing the barrel of the gun at my head. I can feel it sneeze. Manic in its worry. I cry. I whimper. I breathe. I scream. I sustain it. I scream so loud I can feel my throat polymerise blood into tracks of . Ears turning a bright purple. My finger slips, and I am interrupted. "Shut the fuck up!" my neighbour shouts from across the hall, furious at the relative loss of peace my existence has caused to their regular programming. I put the gun down and continue to stare at the wall in front of me, splintered in the flakes of white gloss peeling in the isolated sections of my unjustified desire to live. The doorbell rings. It's my friend. It's my birthday. I just want to die.

### Introduce Friend

"Show us some cleave, honey," boasts the man at the door, holding a half opened-can of Guinness and poorly wrapped . A suitable greeting for this 27 year old writer, dressed in yesterday's t-shirt. A stain on this earth to be admonished in ever diminishing quantities, sunken without Christ. His coarse facial hair brushes against my cheek as he dives in for a hug.


The doorbell rings again. It's Milo. Queen Bee. I race to the door in a rush of excitement, bumping my knee on a bookshelf full of Victorian classics. Surely it made girls wet.

### Friends on the couch

The boob and the sex-queen sat together on the couch opposing, trying to figure out exactly how they fit into this scenario. Was he the child-abuser that he constantly referenced at work? Had they fucked at one point? Why was her hand on my leg?

### Describe Taxi Ride

The driver was a bit of a fuckin' winky. I'm allowed to call him a winky on my Birthday, right? A

You could tell he was having  . I noted not to shake his hand.

The driver spoke three different languages. Japanese, Chinese and Korean.


If I could fuck any emotion I would fuck sadness. It would be your most malleable best friend. It wouldn't care if you beat it, raped it or crushed into a thousand tiny pieces. It would persist in its grief, elated in the distress it had already come to expect of itself. Grateful in your neediness and desperate in your pleasure. It is what Gods come to expect of their young.

### Describe Stripmall

The Mexican restaurant made its home within the matchwood interiors of a refurbished Church, house to slurry of canned beans and quarter-ounce jars



### Describe Mexican Restaurant

The enchilada. An inoffensive mound of maize-infused goop, seared in a second-hand microwave oven on finance. The slosh hammock rolled around on my plate, mummified in a meat-cheese mixture of re-hydrated pus and freeze-dried caesin. A product they used to call 'vinyl chloride' back at the foundry.


### Emotions

I sat back at my desk.

Ah, fuck therapy.
