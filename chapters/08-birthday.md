## Scene 1 START

### Birthday Monologue
<!--
A week of life passes by. The rain runs thin. My hair mauves dry. The work dulls. Today is my birthday. The loneliest day of the year. Crust upon the gallows of my bespawled clamour as the excess from my child-like face, droops n' slaws from the seize of my mother's tainted vagina. Heinous in its moulded cheese scum. Intent on pre-suffocating the elderly in a cacophony of debt n' engouled values. I was destined, at least for the next 24 hours, to remain an empty echo chamber of must-haves and has-beens. Slurry in an aimless deceit of exacerbated usury, grace upon the impression of a fuck-off grin.

### Pondering Birthday

"Welcome to life," I murmur. Arms dangled by the sides. Mouth obtuse from the chaotic glamour of a frozen apple pie. Bosom with a sulphurous cream laid thick across its stomry edge. Motionless in the static frowning of my displaced face; splay against the interference of the living room TV. Enthusaism set aside. Baked as a banana. Compelled to spit n' choke with my own two hands, the remaining joy of life from thy resevoir of me. I turn off the set in a shambolic boredom, ready to lower my expectations to an unequivocal zero. I suppose it was the best I could do with what little faith I had left in myself. The squander was real. Fucking real.

Amongst the sedentary sprinkle of the fine winter gloss, pretty in its edifying temperament, was me. Utterly dejected with a resolve of couch. Caught in a volatile discord of teetering instability, as I questioned the very purpose of my existence on this day. Was a birthday merely an excuse to feel lonely about one's own circumstance? Statutory in its permission to congeal; to be ripped from your soul n' dipped in the pity of its own macabre jealousy. Megalomaniac in its savage. Cunt. Torn. Impassioned. As you sit there in the untenable parking lot of an unmaintained KFC. Face like a fat cunt. Chokin' on a bucket o' chicken you found next to the decomposing corpse of a desiccating pigeon. Spliced in a potato n' gravy so gruesome, and so thick. That its presence alone is enough to emulsify your organs into a disheartening stew of spalled highlight. Ripe for the swollen lips of an frenzied porn-addict, featuring a wet sock for a mother n' a discarded tampon for a lover. You know, for ol' times sake. Buck-aroo.

### Mother Texts

I grouch from my position. It's 10:35am. A text from my mother. Anger. Feelings of respite. They overcome me. Immense in their swallow. That bitch. That fucking bitch. The wrath troves in and around me, aggravating my emotions into an overdrive of biting violence; ensnare against the violent swirl of sweat fell tandem across the hostility of my crimson anarchy. A twitch of self-harm emerges. Resentment. Mottled indigo. I crush my own skull. A fervent aggression circulates within me. Rage. I felt rage. Whirlwind and burst from within the indignation which teased me. Infurating me to a point of voiceless screaming. A catastrophic cuss of doth and cower. My heart weakens. My reaction seeks revulsion. I proceed to block her number. Fuck her. It's the least she deserved.

### Sadness Grows

It's now 10:45am. I don't feel so lucky. Maybe birthdays weren't meant to feel lucky. Maybe they had more to do with glitter and cellophane, than any kind of self-care or routine. My hands turn a frantic cold. With it, an unmatched sense of sadness my fingers had come to parade. Slow and delicate like their fathers. Searching for any semblance of joy which may make itself noticed. Enveloping my body in a web of decaying atrophy. Teaching me silence. Guiding me towards the poorest. I suppose these words were the only thing keeping me from vomitting all over my chest, and excreting the anesthetic holding my misery together. It was time for a bite.

The time is 11:00am. I don't quite know what to make of the saturated bowl of strewn wheat, chaff inside the interior of a wooden catalogue collection. The tasteless slop of a mid-life muck; the food pyramid equivalent of a pitiful mess. The yearn. It defeans in its silent whispers, chasming the cheer you so desperately want to hear. Maybe that was luck. Maybe I was lucky.

### Attempts Suicide

The time is 11:01am. Duct-taped to the underside of my desk is the revolver I purchased last Sunday while scouring for pleasing children at the mall. I'm not sure why I used duct-tape, but it was the kind of visceral which felt complete in this house of proportionate nonsense. I attempt to rip the revolver from the fragmented clumps of dust which had gathered from the absence of my life. Now trailing for a reason to subsist. I place my finger on the trigger of the gun. Barrel pointed at my head. I can feel it sneeze. I breathe. I suppose I wanted to feel like a man in these last few frames before my brain becomes a conflated withdrawal of sentiment. I think of Milo. The love I cannot feel. Sunday autopsy. I whimper. I cry. I scream. It sustains. It reverberates. I scream so loud that I can feel my throat polymerise into clotted blood. My ears turn a bright purple. I'm confident. I can do it. I believe it. I am ready. I stop the screaming and the silence begins.

I pull the trigger. The revolver releases a sudden click of death. I subside, and put the gun down. Continuing to stare at the walls in front of me; splintering at the flakes of white teal, peeling in isolation from the rest of my world. The relief is overwhelming, although expected. I call it gun therapy. I come from work. I point the gun at my head. I scream as loud as I can. I pretend to kill myself. And thus I am free for another day. To pretend as little or as much as I want, until I am reborn a fool into the next day. It's cute, and it proves that I'm marriage material.

The time is now 12:00am. I have fallen asleep for at least 20 minutes. The doorbell rings. It interrupts my beauty sleep. I'm afraid society will judge me. I'm just kidding, of course. It's my friend. It's my birthday. It's my time to animate. It's my time to die.

## Scene 2 START

### Introduce Friend

"Show us some cleave, honey," boasts the burly man at the door. Gauding a half-opened can of Guinness ripple bibacious along a cusp of drivel, stained-deep from within the ruffle of his chestnut sweater. Teeth like a discoloured jigsaw; soilure in the pettily wrapped tea-towel hung coon from the brace of his pastel neck. Ready to start the party; a suitable greeting for this now 27 year old writer, a stain upon this earth to be admonished in ever diminishing quantities. Sunk deep on these shores, without even a hint of Christ to splunder. I thought highly of none. Collapsing on his knees like the gloom of a lamented Jersey deluge, the questionable outpost dives in towards my stiff embezzlement for what seems like an momentous hug. As the weight of his chest digs deep through the barricade of my arms, contrast against the coarse scruff of his beard running taut against my cheek with the unhinge of a drunken tiger. Stench upon the imported persuasion of an ordinary Norwegian beer, as I stood there hoping to survive the next 24 hours without suffering a hemorrhage or a cardiac response. Although even I felt it was too late to survive.

"Alright, alright. Just get inside before my neighbours think I've hired a male prostitute." Only I laugh at the remark. Although we both knew I'd hit gold.

### Friend Seeks Milk

I wasn't quite sure what I to think of my friend as he lumbered his way into my kitchen. A living, breathing exhibit of impulsive extroversion, caked to the brim with enough coffee and powdered ginseng to fund an entire military campaign into the Andes. He was living proof that you could in fact polish a turd, and get away with absolutely anything. I kept a keen eye on him as he proceeded to rummage through my fridge, displacing what little pride I had left amongst the containers of takeout and unmet dairy which had once embraced my stomach. I think he was searching for milk. I really wish he wouldn't.

"Hey, have you got milk?"

"Can you please not drink my milk," I respond.

"Yeah, but I'm currently riding a killer hangover, and you know how much it helps when my stomach is churning." For whatever reason, my friend was convinced that milk was the ultimate hangover cure, akin to blowing Adonis himself. Although it certainly made no sense in my mind. Eventually, the man settled for soy which puzzled me greatly. Since when did I ever drink soy? The work of an imposter. And without the precious delay of thought, the man decides to grab a used cup from within the sink. Pouring the viscous concotion of canola-like substance into the clumpy plop of a lasanga-stained cup, which in retrospect, hadn't been touched for weeks. As the murky splatter of soy abruptly varnishes the outer molecular of his face, cutting briefly into the decomposition of his own high standards for waste. He throws me an emotive smile. I continue to glare.

### Chat With Friend

For the next 40 minutes we both sat there on the couch, making each other laugh. He drank soy under an alcoholic anthem of a make-believe sobriety, and I validated his self-worth with the equivalent cheer of a dying house cat. At the very least it was a worthy distraction from the banality of life; the friction of my own existence.

"Oh, and don't think I'd get a little something for my favourite man!" I guess I was about to be raped. This is what rapists say before they rape someone, right?

### Friend Cup Cake

He places his hand into his brown leather satchel, now crumpled to a point of non-trivial athritis. The grin on his face intensifies with the giddy laughter of a manic 12 year old and in its place, appears what seems to be an extensively mangled cupcake. Conveniently wrapped with a cling film so thin that the food dye had leeched into the plastic as if it were still fashionable to sniff lead paint. He hands me the cupcake with the motion of a wounded giant, as he describes in excruciating detail the amount of effort placed both into the purchasing and transport of my gift. I smile vainly. Upon closer examination I wasn't even quite sure if it were a cupcake at all. It was more like a poorly conceived thought, glazed in the Satanic oven of an offshore abattoir. Icing as hard as dried clay. Texture like camel's blood. Encased within the piffle centre of a soggy nightmare. My teeth turned to dust. My lungs did not feel safe.

### 

Entertaining the idea of suicide for a second time today, my door bell rings again. Perhaps it was the police, coming to detain me for having poor taste in friends. Perhaps it was an angry neighbour, intent on pointing out my ethnicity to the disdain. I approach the door. It's Milo.



My doorbell rings again.



Larry was an

The doorbell rings again. It's Milo. Queen Bee. I race to the door in a rush of excitement, bumping my knee on a bookshelf full of Victorian classics. Surely it made girls wet.

### Friends on the couch

The boob and the sex-queen sat together on the couch opposing, trying to figure out exactly how they fit into this scenario. Was he the child-abuser that he constantly referenced at work? Had they fucked at one point? Why was her hand on my leg?

You could tell he was having  . I noted not to shake his hand.

The driver spoke three different languages. Japanese, Chinese and Korean.


If I could fuck any emotion I would fuck sadness. It would be your most malleable best friend. It wouldn't care if you beat it, raped it or crushed into a thousand tiny pieces. It would persist in its grief, elated in the distress it had already come to expect of itself. Grateful in your neediness and desperate in your pleasure. It is what Gods come to expect of their young.

### Describe Stripmall

The Mexican restaurant made its home within the matchwood interiors of a refurbished Church, house to slurry of canned beans and quarter-ounce jars



### Describe Mexican Restaurant

The enchilada. An inoffensive mound of maize-infused goop, seared in a second-hand microwave oven on finance. The slosh hammock rolled around on my plate, mummified in a meat-cheese mixture of re-hydrated pus and freeze-dried caesin. A product they used to call 'vinyl chloride' back at the foundry.
