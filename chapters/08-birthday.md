### Birthday Monologue

A week of life passes by. The rain runs thin. My hair mauves dry. The work dulls. Today is my birthday. The loneliest day of the year. Crust upon the gallows of my bespawled clamour as the excess from my child-like face, droops n' slaws from the seize of my mother's tainted vagina. Heinous in its moulded cheese scum. Intent on pre-suffocating the elderly in a cacophony of debt n' engouled values. I was destined, at least for the next 24 hours, to remain an empty echo chamber of must-haves and has-beens. Slurry in an aimless deceit of exacerbated usury, grace upon the impression of a fuck-off grin.

### Pondering Birthday

"Welcome to life," I murmur to the depths of my sorrow. Arms dangled by the sides. Mouth obtuse from the chaotic glamour of a frozen apple pie. Bosom with a sulphurous cream laid thick across its stomry edge. Motionless in the static frowning of my displaced face; splay against the interference of the living room TV. Enthusaism set aside. Baked as a banana. Compelled to spit n' choke with my own two hands, the remaining joy of life from thy resevoir of me. I turn off the set in a shambolic boredom, ready to lower my expectations to an unequivocal zero. I suppose it was the best I could do with what little faith I had left in myself. The squander was real. Fucking real.

Amongst the sedentary sprinkle of the fine winter gloss, pretty in its edifying temperament, was me. Utterly dejected with a resolve of couch. Caught in a volatile discord of teetering instability, as I questioned the very purpose of my existence on this day. Was a birthday merely an excuse to feel lonely about one's own circumstance? Statutory in its permission to congeal; to be ripped from your soul n' dipped in the pity of its own macabre jealousy. Megalomaniac in its savage. Cunt. Torn. Impassioned. As you sit there in the untenable parking lot of an unmaintained KFC. Face like a fat cunt. Chokin' on a bucket o' chicken you found next to the decomposing corpse of a desiccating pigeon. Spliced in a potato n' gravy so gruesome, and so thick. That its presence alone is enough to emulsify your organs into a disheartening stew of spalled highlight. Ripe for the swollen lips of an frenzied porn-addict, featuring a wet sock for a mother n' a discarded tampon for a lover. You know, for ol' times sake. Buck-aroo.

### Mother Texts

I grouch from my position. It's 10:35am. A text from my mother. Anger. Feelings of respite. They overcome me. Immense in their swallow. That bitch. That fucking bitch. The wrath troves in and around me, aggravating my emotions into an overdrive of biting violence; ensnare against the violent swirl of sweat fell tandem across the hostility of my crimson anarchy. A twitch of self-harm emerges. Resentment. Mottled indigo. I crush my own skull. A fervent aggression circulates within me. Rage. I felt rage. Whirlwind and burst from within the indignation which teased me. Infurating me to a point of voiceless screaming. A catastrophic cuss of doth and cower. My heart weakens. My reaction seeks revulsion. I proceed to block her number. Fuck her. It's the least she deserved.

### Sadness Grows

It's now 10:45am. I don't feel so lucky. Maybe birthdays weren't meant to feel lucky. Maybe they had more to do with glitter and cellophane, than any kind of self-care or routine. My hands turn a frantic cold. With it, an unmatched sense of sadness my fingers had come to parade. Slow and delicate like their fathers. Searching for any semblance of joy which may make itself noticed. Enveloping my body in a web of decaying atrophy. Teaching me silence. Guiding me towards the poorest. I suppose these words were the only thing keeping me from vomitting all over my chest, and excreting the anesthetic holding my misery together. It was time for a bite.

The time is 11:00am. I don't quite know what to make of the saturated bowl of strewn wheat, chaff inside the interior of a wooden catalogue collection. The tasteless slop of a mid-life muck; the food pyramid equivalent of a pitiful mess. The yearn. It defeans in its silent whispers, chasming the cheer you so desperately want to hear. Maybe that was luck. Maybe I was lucky.

### Gun Therapy

The time is 11:01am. Duct-taped to the underside of my desk is the revolver I purchased last Sunday while scouring for pleasing children at the mall. I'm not sure why I used duct-tape, but it was the kind of visceral which felt complete in this house of proportionate nonsense. I attempt to rip the revolver from the fragmented clumps of dust which had gathered from the absence of my life. Now trailing for a reason to subsist. I place my finger on the trigger of the gun. Barrel pointed at my head. I can feel it sneeze. I breathe. I suppose I wanted to feel like a man in these last few frames before my brain becomes a conflated withdrawal of sentiment. I think of Milo. The love I cannot feel. Sunday autopsy. I whimper. I cry. I scream. It sustains. It reverberates. I scream so loud that I can feel my throat polymerise into clotted blood. My ears turn a bright purple. I'm confident. I can do it. I believe it. I am ready. I stop the screaming and the silence begins.

I pull the trigger. The revolver releases a sudden click of death. I subside. The revolver is placed down as I continue to stare at the wall in front of me; splintering at the flakes of white teal, peeling in isolation from the rest of my world. The relief is overwhelming, although expected. I call it gun therapy. I come from work. I point the gun at my head. I scream as loud as I can. I pretend to kill myself. And thus I am free for another day. To pretend as little or as much as I want, until I am reborn a fool into the next day. It's cute, and it proves that I'm marriage material.

### Friend Arrives

The time is now 12:00am. I have fallen asleep for at least 20 minutes. The doorbell rings. It interrupts my beauty sleep. I'm afraid society will judge me. I'm just kidding, of course. It's my friend. It's my birthday. It's my time to animate. It's my time to die.

## Scene 2 START -

### Introduce Friend

"Show us some cleave, honey," boasts the burly man at the door. Gauding a half-opened can of Guinness ripple bibacious along a cusp of drivel, stained-deep from within the ruffle of his chestnut sweater. Teeth like a discoloured jigsaw; soilure in the pettily wrapped tea-towel hung coon from the brace of his pastel neck. Ready to start the party; a suitable greeting for this now 27 year old writer, a stain upon this earth to be admonished in ever diminishing quantities. Sunk deep on these shores, without even a hint of Christ to splunder. I thought highly of none. Collapsing on his knees like the gloom of a lamented Jersey deluge, the questionable outpost dives in towards my stiff embezzlement for what seems like an momentous hug. As the weight of his chest digs deep through the barricade of my arms, contrast against the coarse scruff of his beard running taut against my cheek with the unhinge of a drunken tiger. Stench upon the imported persuasion of an ordinary Norwegian beer, as I stood there hoping to survive the next 24 hours without suffering a hemorrhage or a cardiac response. Although even I felt it was too late to survive.

"Alright, alright. Just get inside before my neighbours think I've hired a male prostitute." Only I laugh at the remark. Although we both knew I'd hit gold.

### Friend Seeks Milk

I wasn't quite sure what I to think of my friend as he lumbered his way into my kitchen. A living, breathing exhibit of impulsive extroversion, caked to the brim with enough coffee and powdered ginseng to fund an entire military campaign into the Andes. He was living proof that you could in fact polish a turd, and get away with absolutely anything. I kept a keen eye on him as he proceeded to rummage through my fridge, displacing what little pride I had left amongst the containers of takeout and unmet dairy which had once embraced my stomach. I think he was searching for milk. I really wish he wouldn't.

"Hey, have you got milk?"

"Can you please not drink my milk," I respond.

"Yeah, but I'm currently riding a killer hangover, and you know how much it helps when my stomach is churning." For whatever reason, my friend was convinced that milk was the ultimate hangover cure, akin to blowing Adonis himself. Although it certainly made no sense in my mind. Eventually, the man settled for soy which puzzled me greatly. Since when did I ever drink soy? The work of an imposter. And without the precious delay of thought, the man decides to grab a used cup from within the sink. Pouring the viscous concotion of canola-like substance into the clumpy plop of a lasanga-stained cup, which in retrospect, hadn't been touched for weeks. As the murky splatter of soy abruptly varnishes the outer molecular of his face, cutting briefly into the decomposition of his own high standards for waste. He throws me an emotive smile. I continue to glare.

### Chat With Friend

For the next 40 minutes we both sat there on the couch, making each other laugh. He drank soy under an alcoholic anthem of a make-believe sobriety, and I validated his self-worth with the equivalent cheer of a dying house cat. At the very least it was a worthy distraction from the banality of life; the friction of my own existence.

"Oh, and don't think I'd get a little something for my favourite man!" I guess I was about to be raped. This is what rapists say before they rape someone, right?

### Friend Has Gift

He places his hand into a brown leather satchel, now crumpled to a point of non-trivial athritis. Giddy with the laughter of a manic 12 year old. And with my expectations set firmly low, he takes out what appears to be an extensively mangled cupcake.

"Tada! It's a cupcake!"

The cling wrap surrounding the cupcake was so thin that the food dye had leeched into the plastic as if it were still fashionable to sniff lead paint. Flourished with pride, he hands over the cupcake with the poise of a wounded giant. Ready to describe in excruciating detail the amount of effort spent both into the purchasing and transport of my gift. I smile vainly. He only notices the smile. And upon closer examination, I wasn't even quite sure if the object currently being held in my hand was even a cupcake at all. Visually it described a poorly conceived thought. Glazed inside the Satanic womb of an offshore demon, with the resolve to announce the inedible within the confines of man's mouth. Icing as hard as dried clay; flush with the pigment of a poor man's toe. It was a soggy nightmare, encased within the piffle centre of a Wallmart clearance aisle. Begging to decompose. I decide to risk a bite in an act of dole sincerity. My teeth proceed to disperse into a mesh dust. Reconstitute me baby. Feed my sin.

<!-- CONTINUE, I need to discuss more. -->

### The Door Bell Rings

And before I'm able to entertain the idea of engaging culinary suicide for a second time, the door bell rings again. Confused by the melodic chime, I didn't quite know who it could be. Perhaps it was the police, coming to detain me for having poor taste in friends. An angry neighbour intent on pointing out my ethnicity to the disdain of the other diehard racists from within the building. I approach the door. It's Milo.

## Scene 3 START

### Milo Appears

"Hi."

I didn't know how to respond. As I stood there in a grave of my own silence, paralysed by a sense of disbelief which had now rapidly spiraled into an ungovernable anxiety. Split amongst the disconfigured emotions I'd been signaling for days, as a signal for psychological help. I wanted to run, but I didn't know how. Then her touch. I can feel her hand holding mine. Sharing our warmth together in the vast coldness of this world. She looks sad and afraid. What was happening to me? Had I just died?

### Milo Acid Gift

"I'm sorry for just showing up here out of the blue, but I couldn't stop thinking about you. And I knew it was your birthday today, so I got you this." She hands over a decorated box, characterised by its stark purple bow. My favourite colour. Inside was a birthday card which read in rabble fashion, "I'm sorry for being such a bitch. Love Milo. xoxo." And above the text, attached delicately with a single strand of tape was a sheet of acid with our names printed in cursive for the whole world to see.

"I thought we could take it together. Just you and me. Will you please be with me?" I stood there confused. Excited. Broken. My friend decides to interject.

"What are you doing, ya fuckin' nipper!? My pussy's getting wet thinking about you." I felt embarassed.

### Character Forgives Milo

"It's okay, I'll just be a second." I close the apartment door. We both stand outside. She leans in for a kiss. I accept it. We hold each other intensely. I feel gross, yet wanted. Incestuous, even. Stranded by her touch. And yet I felt consumed by her presence. The bugs in her eyes. The way her hair brushed against my face, and refused to dettach from my pores. I wanted her closer and closer to my heart and yet no matter how close she ever was, it felt as if she were a million miles away. Kept from my emotions which so desperately wanted her approval. We continued to look each other in the eyes, mesmerised by the vulnerability which made itself present in each other's presence. I wanted her more than I wanted myself, and I was dying for any kind of fix. The feeling of her skin overwhelms me with the splendor of a anasthetic caress. I felt me. Disheveled and desire.

### Character Invites Milo Inside

"Would you like to come inside?" She pauses with a look of approval. Happy to know that she didn't have to walk home alone, ready to slit her wrists as was evident via the see-through mesh. Laying by the wayside in a pool of her own blood; ready to take a cumshot from the next door neighbour's dead cat. I wanted to fuck her bad. Ideally we'd just head back to the couch and cuddle until the universe had disintegrated into a unequivocal mesh of sex and puppy love, but that clearly wasn't going to happen. I lead her into the living room.

### Friend Attempts Smalltalk

"So, do you like milk?" My friend was hardly a genius when it came to small talk. In fact, he was hardly a genius at all, but at the very least it made me seem less weird. Which was more than any friend could ask for.

"Absolutely. I'm a huge proponent of industrial dairy." I don't think he understood. The post-ironic sardonicism was too much for his hangover to handle, as he sat there, grinning profusely at her gothic reformation dress. Shoulders like a fractured gargoyle, as he withdrew into his shell with the stunted tenacity of a senile clam. Milo remained content, although clearly annoyed that we couldn't just be alone and fuck until the early hours of the morning.

### Discuss Dinner

"Say, what's happening with dinner? I'm absolutely starving." It was clear my friend had become agitated. It was getting late. The soy had run dry, and the ensuing levels of awkwardness of having both a lover and an idiot in the same room at the same time, was becomig more than apparent. On the topic of dinner, I was definitely craving Mexican. An indisposed banquet of bean n' string meat, lust within the sepia-inspired warmth of a mud encrusted outhouse; anagolous to being mounted by a matador at your local parlé. Milo got the reference. The Roman felt dirty in his Greek specks.

"Well fuck, Mexican it is then. I'll call a cab. You tell me the location." We all leave the apartment in a daze of oaf, consumed by the dreary cloudiness of the weekend. Not only was this situation unideal, but it was pleasantly grotesque in its outcome. Milo, the only thing I've ever cared about more than my own misery, was standing beside me. Harrowing as ever. Spellbind in her . I was falling down the rabbithole for a second time and I knew it was going to end poorly when it all came crashing down. As we collectively walked towards the elevator, drull in the unnerve of the mismatch of the group, I heard the door of fellow neighbour open. Standing behind me, tapping me on the shoulder. It was Mia.

"Hey stranger," whispers Mia. Beam with an appearance of joy. Gorgeous in her bright red cheeks, as beautiful as her hair which tempers with my emotions in a soliloquy of rejoice. Milo grabs my hand.

"Oh, hey there. Funny seeing you around. I'm guessing you've been stalking me again." Mia giggles. It makes me smile. There was something about her which made me feel warm. Appreciated. I liked it and I wasn't going to pretend.

"What are your plans for this evening?"

"Oh, I'm just heading out to dinner. It's my birthday today, thought I'd have a little celebration." Milo smiles vainly.

"That's super cool! Happy birthday! I hope it's been a fun one." It struck me that I hadn't really thought about this idea of fun for a while. My mind had instead isolated itself into the dark ill-conceived recesses of smut and degradation. Pounding virulently in a violent attempt at self-mastication. Preoccupied. I began breathing heavily.

"I was just going to head out and grab some takeout," iterates Mia.

"Say uh, would you like to come to dinner with us? It'd be great to have you there." Milo was not happy.

"Oh, sure! If it's not too much of a hassle."

"Of course not, it'll be fun."

We all stood outside of the apartment building for a moment, patched together by the bewilderment of a shame few. Waiting for our cab to arrive, as the night sky gleamed

My friend was barely conscious. Milo was considerably peeved at the addition of one more obstacle to confront. Mia was wholesomely intimidated. And I'd felt utterly guilty in reintroducing Milo into my life; a seemingly poor decision in retrospect. But I was depressed, and I didn't care.

The driver pulls up to the curb.
