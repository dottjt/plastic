Welcome to life.

<!-- Editor and Character Introduction -->

A rancid fascination of all things particular, crown jewel to the unjustified misery we all pretend to mimic and understand. A floundering point of asymptotic reference, carelessly vague in it's accelerating motion, nauseous in the underlying assumptions creeping it's blood into our veins. A rag-doll daddy of putty intentions, spluttered viscous into the cultural misappropriation you slowly witness before your eyes. This is where all stories begin, end and...

"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room, as he swivels his chair towards me in a hesitant gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, dawdling frantic on a notepad fit suitably for a 90s' Nickelodeon wonderland, struck brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares. Only crumbs were left of the star-mangled biscuits, presumably store-bought for our excited listeners at home.

"I really, really liked what you did there. I thought it was simply fantastic! The imagery. The sex appeal. I could definitely fuck that, if you know what I mean."

Naturally, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. Was it a generous expression of misplaced animosity? Was it the beginning of what was to become one of those laborious online pranks, where I, the unwitting idiot, were to be exposed as some part-time celebrity on a popular Japanese game show? Perhaps it was the result of a fatherless upbringing, left to be developed in an environment full of conservative women, keen on beating the fluff out of potato to prove it's worth in the inter-continental submission of 3rd world countries. Sure, I'd probably fuck it too. Me and my words, dressed in mortal calamity, blind in an unfortunate sexual encounter involving my last moments in an exploding orgasm, and a terribly shy lackey with a syllable for a grin.

Although I suppose it was the level of respect I garnered as an unknown assailant, possibly attached to his meaningless gestures, delivered haphazardly like the illegitimate leader of guerilla war. Che guevara au lite, the raved lunatic of a ritual patriarchal circle-jerk, head o' the New and Improved Mickey Mouse Club, accent dripped-thick in the ancient tar of a dead Italian, laid limp over his heartless sleeves and into the repeating glares of purgatory, where real estate agents and car salesmen devised schemes to enumerate the poor. Reassured only by the brash exterior of a three-hour Tony Robbins lecture he once witnessed in full three minute summary, the man basked in a level of self-gratification not seen since the Holy Roman Empire. Then across the border, sitting awkwardly by the wayside was me, a clash between the unsettling intentions revealing themselves in the feint colonies of pop-sweat rippling in the arcade through my skin. I couldn't have been more uncomfortable, but I assured myself that everything would be okay, as long as I continued to embrace the sodomy. Thankfully, Aristotle was blasphemous.

"You know, have you ever considered writing this, uh, material into a book? I think it would make for fascinating reading."

"Well yeah, that's basically why I'm here. To get my book published," sat an audaciously sad man preoccupied firmly in this chair, made solely of the materials of imported wood and steel products, helplessly situated in this very moment as a dead man, one tamper away from enlightening expedition, conveniently puzzled at the present-day theatrics of this man's somewhat infectious outreach. The stench was honestly a blessing and I dearly hoped it would kill me before rendering me in entire paralysis.

Soon an entire lifetime of smalltalk and faux pleasantries would transpire in my head, capturing me in arrival of Dante's fuck-pen of ill-conceived entertainment, and in the wisp that followed from the dry words nailing my jaw to high ceiling above, it genuinely felt as if we were getting nowhere. He wanted to see himself in everything, and I simply wanted to be acknowledged, loved and possibly adjourned. He was like the father I never had.

Catching him off guard, now that I was fully disinterested in anything he had to say, I decided reach for the mug o' water conveniently placed next to the picture of a young child, dressed in the sexual undertones of a sparkling cheerleader's outfit, presumably to have the words "Daddy's girl" tattooed on her forehead before being fucked in front of an eager camera-crew and a live internet audience of millions. And as the lukewarm liquid trickled down my throat, even my basic bodily functions could sense the desperation of this poor man, developing itself into a middle-aged caricature, deep-throating a homeless veteran for the warm company of street-lovin' destitution. His deadbeat practice. The filament of gore that shone like a piercing laser through his frail heart. At one point, I could even swear he was trying to sell me a phone plan, subtle in the sign language of his fingers remise. In contemporary fashion, outweighing all possibility, I attempted a deep sigh to maintain composure, followed by a unwitting gasp at the clamature of this fool, bringing my smile to a full, unmatched forte. It was obvious I'd already failed myself.

"Hey, it's fast approaching twelve and I'd kill for a bite. You like Chinese? You're Chinese, right? I mean, you just have that slight gook look to you, no offense, cutter." Sure. Nothing offensive about wish-washing the complete unadulterated scum from my life, you pantomime piece of shit. I've scraped less-abrasive gunk from the self-mutilated pussy of a dead-hooker's final stand at a crack-clinic than I've spent today hearing you mutter two-ounces of garbage into my eyes. Ah, who even cares anymore. I'm sure his wanton style is just the kind of tautological shazam to turns heads and kick books. The kind of frolic that apparently, readers desperately want to fuck.

<!-- Editor Office Description -->

Attempting to leave the office was a frivolous scruffle of hard tactics and self-determination, even more so than my attempt to weasel myself in. Between wades of paper stacked chronologically in ways that would have left a physically handicapped man in existential crisis, and what seemed like a fossilized pocket of methane from the Mesozoic period, left only enough oxygen in a tightly-concealed vacuum of quantum necessity, designed cunningly for the efficient gills of literary agents and art critics. Begging me in drape tones, like a Catholic choir of desperate school children, the scattered array of stationary and clutter surrounded me in a wildfire of nomadic appeal, begging me to stay and mould my soul into the decor. From the cruft flower wallpaper, to the reoccurring stains which revealed themselves as Tommy and Russ, nothing felt untarnished, nor logically brave in this maze of recollection. Even the mould in the dark corners of the room had gained somewhat of a celebrity status, stacked with old writer's manuscripts from the Dreamtime. A haughty Machiavellian fashion statement, the editor put it, as he guided me out through the large, indecent apertures of 136 Brightridge Avenue. It was time to reacquaint myself with the smack, shovel and swing of these mean city streets.

<!-- Chinatown Observation -->

I suppose Chinatown is the same everywhere you go. Unadorned paper lanterns slathered in the embrace of inner-city smog. Conveniently branded in red, patriotic red and tantamount yellow. A mass-produced line of quasi-communism branded with symbols of luck and whore, within a leftover packet of MSG conveniently placed arm's away from a gun and a used needle. A blessing designed to forget and impress, because family comes first when your dying relative collapses at your knees, vomiting collagulated semen in a patriotic display of sex and fervour. You can even smell hints of homemade chicken stock, plagued inconsequential with Grandpa's cigarette ash, fresh from the noodle shop next door ...or was that the sewer below, astew with herbs and delicacies fine China upholds with such embellish. I suppose we were only one coronary away from finding out, as our view widened and our sense of place vanished into a cold dark room of complete apprehension.

"I wanted to become a writer once," the editor blurted, as if making some kind of ultimate sacrifice against his own will.

"But I figured the money was better on the other side of the fence. You know, where the prairies sits. The prairie! Dude, I'm absolutely killin' it with these metaphors!"

As I continued to walk down these grease-ridden lanes, plastered many times over with a volcanic certainty of cheap glue and holographic print, supplied senseless by a broken working-class confused by the fundamental principles of exterior chic, all I could feel in this very moment was the tip of my knees sink ever-so silently into the mound of my socks, like a slow-tide of faithlessness being dragged back into reef, never to be surfaced again. It was the kind of thing that would always unanimously end in a homeless cheer of despondence, gurgling itself away in two-time staunch of mass-hysteria.

<!-- Chinese Restaurant - Arrival and Ordering -->

I couldn't help but notice the dull eggshell yellows on the walls of the Chinese restaurant (suitably named, The Ming) as I walked in, juxtaposed against the depleted faces of a trodden theatre affair, now frantically eradicating itself as part of a grand, self-serving pursuit of cathartic, emotional absolution. The expectation was vast, ripping itself methodologically into our skin and scolding bone as this manâ€™s poor goofy sidekick. Those flakey lines of trodden harmony? Were they real? Did they seek pleasure? Only time could review the shockingly empty response those things of questions deserved.

We both sat comfortably at a booth for three. Chances are, the third person had decided to kill themselves, driven mad by the delicate tension of a racist and his gook-inspired raciee. He of course insisted on sitting on the cushioned fabric below, because apparently asking for my opinion was simply too much. Take, steal and conflate at any cost, no matter what the injury, and be sure to gather the receipt come tax time for a reasonable outcome and a pot of coined silver. Perhaps it was simple American policy to be an asshole.

"Listen, I know you think I'm not the brightest guy, but I'm the connections. The Wowser. Fantastic bloody connections, I'd say" the editor remarked, unintentionally resolute in the danky confines of a valium-infused mind, sedated only in cliche.

"So do you like the book?" I retorted, keen to hear what misaligned innocence could be extracted from the two useless lumps of flesh surrounding his open-closey thingy.

"I think it has potential, kid," who in a momentary relapse, revealed himself as an incapacitated five-year-old before snapping back into his adult form, without even a thought being produced within the five mile dead-zone of his brain. Slyly placing his hands back behind his head, nearly knocking over a priceless Chinese vase within the process, the urgency in the room suddenly took a step back, gasping at it's lungs, only to be shot in the head by a lone ranger with a keyboard and a dull appetite for loose beginnings. All in a day's work.

"Although I have to say, just between you and me, but some things make me feel really uneasy. Like, what the hell even is a 'putty intention'? Is that some weird sexual thing, because you know I'm not down for that."

"I mean, I gue..."

"Hey, waiter! Where are the dumps at! Yo. I'm just kidding, although I would really appreciate a fresh menu. This one smells like chicken grease. Oh, and two seltzer waters please! It's like I'm tryin' throat-fuck a sauna in here."

Only he would have the audacity to confuse verbal harassment for excellent customer service. Balthazar, Gaspar and Melchior, a commercial success of comical foundry. First you cut the cunt down. Then you leave them bleeding in a flurry of panic and lean excavation. Then you crepe your victim via a most beautiful method of distortion, taught only by seventh century con-artists and those with a phonetic tradition to lie. The editor insisted that the waiter stand silently by, on some kind of distress call, as he scanned through the menu with the glance of a dying senior.

"Let's see. I will have the 6-piece pork dumpling outlet, along with a chicken n' corn soup and, um, could I please also have a serving of some Singapore noodles? Fuck I love noodles."

The waiter, the raw-prize of Mr. Ming himself, a beaten Chinese daughter with a taste for obedience and a genetic preamble for financial servitude, exercised a compendium of boredom in the broken English she repeated as the editor attempted culinary sacrilege on an excruciating timeline. It was a level of disrespect that transcended cultural boundaries, and left nothing of the tarnished image of an immature child. Certainly, I doubt the restaurant owners enjoyed their daughter being harassed by a mid-aged white man, caught standing in the corner of the misshapen box, cautiously eyeing customers and the amount of food they were wasting, to the deep sighs of post-war prawn-crackle sentiment. Noodle in. Noodle out. Break a hand and shut the fuck up. I was ready to order.

"I think I'll have..."

"So junior, tell me about your book then. Are we talkin' fantasy here? I don't remember readin' about no goblins or nuthin'." At this point I was equally as hungry as I was keen to have him shut up, although realising my cake had already been trampled, spat on and shared amongst the consortium of bacteria suckling their teats upon the tears of happiness they treated like a once in a lifetime event, I re-inserted the misery module back into the conveniently-placed slot behind my skull, now programmed to endure whatever existing attrition against the human soul.

"I suppose I would describe it as a coagulation of torment. A story which takes you through the thoughts and interactions of a character who violently degrades to a point of complete destitution, certainly in the least gracious of ways," I answered, ready to endure a concise refraction of meaningless assault.

"You know I don't do fantasy, right? That sounds like some weird Tolkein shit. You know, I'm all about the human story. I'm a man of feeling and I love hot integrity pieces."

For sparse moment we both stared at each other, like two brothers who hadn't quite met before. Although we both knew what we wanted, maybe we'd reached a point of where we were both too old to truly understand each other. At the very least, I knew that I'd had enough of his antics and aside from literally grabbing my spoon and shoving it into his eye before skull fucking him, I squeezed my lips and expressed myself with an incredibly tense air of release.

"I don't think this is going to work out," I murmured, hand on my bag, ready to make a run for it, before being interrupted by the waiter carrying plates full of hot, steaming food, fresh from the packet. And although it clearly felt like a bad-date gone worse, it also felt a bit like a bad break up, without the outcome of syphilis. I'm not quite sure how he felt as he sat there, breaking into his Singapore noodles and gobbling up the rasher twins' lesser cousins, in an all-out homicide of culinary scorched earth. The mood had shifted and something vulnerable had been touched within him, as he broke down sobbing into the billowing steam of particulate oyster-sauce and toilet water.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry," he said, with bits of noodle stuck to his face, like a child's mural gone horribly wrong.

"But I need this job. I really do. Fuck. I'm on last strings buddy. You don't know how badly I need this! I promise I'll try harder, okay!?" As far as I was concerned, it wasn't a matter of effort, so much as it was a matter of incompatibility, and I wasn't keen on teaching a dead dog new tricks. The insincerity on the walls, now developing into a dark purple, was no different to kissing your daughter goodnight after raping a homeless woman the night before, in a desperate ploy to get back at her mother.

"I just don't think you really get it. It's almost as if you didn't even read the book."

"What, are you calling me stupid?" retorted the Italian barbarism he sought as a defensive mechanism against all means of life.

"Does it even make a difference?"

At this point, I was certain he'd finally crumble and return back into the pit of magma from which he formed. Scheming in delicate ways

"What if I told you that


The cheque came squalid



<!-- Restaurant Leave -->

As walked out of the Chinese restaurant, feet nimble from the
