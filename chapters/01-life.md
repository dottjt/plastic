<!-- Editor and Character Introduction -->

Welcome to life. A rancid fascination of all things particular. An overwhelming sense of asymptotic reference. America's rag-doll daddy of putty intentions, spluttered viscous into the cultural misappropriation you slowly witness before your very eyes. This is where all stories begin, end and...

"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room, as he swivels in his chair towards my general direction. Hesitant in a gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, deliriously struck brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares. Only crumbs were left of the star-mangled biscuits, presumably store-bought for our excited listeners at home. He was the heartless operator who would introduce himself as my only lifeline into the world of publishing, and I was the incompatible liar who intended to milk his acquaintance until his bare nipples ran raw.

"I really, really liked what you did there. I thought it was simply fantastic! The imagery. The sex appeal. I could definitely fuck that, if you know what I mean."

Naturally, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. Was it a generous expression of misplaced animosity? Was it the beginning of what was to become a laborious online prank, where I, the unwitting idiot, were to be exposed as some part-time celebrity on a popular Japanese game show? Perhaps it was the result of a fatherless upbringing, rushed in an environment full of conservative vice-chancellors from the backwaters of a clandestine women's society, keen on beating the fluff out of potato to prove it's self-worth in the inter-continental submission of 3rd world delight. Sure, I'd probably fuck it too. Me and my words, dressed in mortal calamity, blind in an unfortunate sexual encounter involving my last moments in an exploding orgasm, and a terribly shy lackey with an exotic syllable for a grin.

Although I suppose it was the level of respect I garnered as an unknown assailant, possibly attached to his meaningless gestures delivered haphazardly like the illegitimate leader of an unknown guerilla war. Che guevara au lite, the raved lunatic of a ritual patriarchal circle-jerk, head o' the New and Improved Mickey Mouse Club, accent dripped-thick in the ancient tar of a dead Italian laid limp over his heartless sleeves and into the repeating glares of purgatory. A cursory monument in time where real estate agents and car salesmen devised schemes to enumerate the poor. He was a man reassured by the might and mercy of a three-hour Tony Robbins lecture once witnessed in full three-minute summary, basked in a level of self-gratification not last seen since the Holy Roman Empire. Then across the border, intrepid behind an facade of U.N. sponsored barbed-wire and a conundrum of dolly-cash, sitting awkwardly by the wayside in an enclosure of false attitudes and echoing dialogue was me. An unruly clash against the unsettling intentions revealing themselves in the feint colonies of pop-sweat rippling through the arcade of my skin. I couldn't have been more uncomfortable, nor under-represented in this fraudulent battering of intellectual deceit, but I assured myself that everything would be okay as long as I continued to embrace the sodomy in full. Thankfully, Aristotle was blasphemous.

"You know, have you ever considered writing this, uh, material into a book? I think it would make for fascinating reading."

"Well yeah, that's basically why I'm here. To get my book published," sat an audaciously sad man preoccupied firmly in this chair, helplessly situated in the mire of time, conveniently puzzled at the present-day theatrics of this man's somewhat infectious outreach. The corduous stench which leaked from the mangled pipes from within the ceiling above provided a welcome blessing to the establishment of incredulous publishing, thankfully contained within the four walls of this room. The curse and downfall of a 70s' decor filled to the brim with unwashed tupperware and plastic varnish, tainted by the sickly yellow synthesis oozing itself from a congregation of fake plants situated on a lonely shelf to the north, and into decrepit the atmosphere of the dimly lit room. Providing just enough grim to keep the magic of creativity from harming anyone.

Soon an entire lifetime of smalltalk and faux pleasantries would transpire in my head, capturing me in arrival at Dante's fuck-pen of ill-conceived ecstasy. And in the wisp that followed from the dry words nailing my jaw to hardwood floors below, it genuinely felt as if we were getting nowhere. He wanted to see himself in everything, and I simply wanted to be acknowledged, loved and possibly adjourned like a house cat on trial for dragging a dead, mutilated creature into the house during a heated game of Friday night football.

Catching him off guard, now that I was fully disinterested in anything he had to say, I decided to reach for the mug o' water conveniently placed next to the picture of a scantily-dressed child in tight cheerleader's seduce, presumably to have the words "Daddy's girl" tattooed on her forehead before being fucked in front of an eager camera-crew and a live internet audience of millions. Yakuza's finest. And as the lukewarm liquid trickled down my throat, even my basic bodily functions could sense the paltry desperation of this poor man's attempt at azure, developing itself into the middle-aged caricature of a homeless veteran deep-throating his prized roadkill for the thrill of the violence. His deadbeat practice. The filament of gore that shone like a piercing light through his frail heart. At one point, I was convinced he was trying to sell me a phone plan, subtle in the dubious hints of unintelligible sign language his fingers deliberated. Outweighing all logical possibility, I attempted to let out a deep sigh before bringing my smile to a full, unmatched forte.

"It's fast approaching twelve and I'd kill for a bite. You like Chinese? You're Chinese, right? I mean, you just have that slight gook look to you, no offense, cutter." Sure. Nothing offensive about wish-washing the unadulterated scum out of my life. You pantomime sack of shit. I've scraped less-abrasive gunk from the self-mutilated pussy of a dead-hooker's final stand at a crack-clinic shootout than I've spent today hearing you mutter two-ounces of garbage into the lexical sinkhole you're now created. Ah, who even cares anymore. I'm sure his wanton style was just the kind of tautological caprice required to turns heads and kick books off shelves and into the wounded hands of today's consumer. The kind of frolic that apparently, readers desperately want to fuck.

<!-- Editor Office Description -->

Attempting to leave the office was a frivolous scruffle of hard tactics and self-determination, even more so than my initial struggle to weasel myself into the world of publishing. Between wades of paper stacked chronologically in ways that would leave a physically handicapped man in existential crisis, and what seemed like a fossilized pocket of methane from the Mesozoic period, left only enough oxygen in a tightly-concealed vacuum of quantum necessity, designed cunningly for the efficient gills of literary agents and art critics. Begging me in drape tones, like a Catholic choir of desperate school children, the scattered array of stationary and clutter surrounded me in a wildfire of nomadic appeal, begging me to stay and offer my soul to the lord of decor sitting idly by in frizzled drab tones. From the cruft flower wallpaper, to the reoccurring stains which revealed themselves as Tommy and Russ, nothing felt untarnished, nor logically brave in this maze of recollection. Even the mould in the dark corners of the room had gained somewhat of a celebrity status, stacked with old writer's manuscripts from the Dreamtime. A haughty Machiavellian ruse, the editor put it, as he guided me out through the large indecent apertures of 136 Brightridge Avenue. Following what seemed like an eternity, it was nice to once again reacquaint myself with the smack, shovel and swing of these mean city streets.

<!-- Chinatown Observation -->

I suppose Chinatown is the same everywhere you go. Unadorned paper lanterns slathered in the embrace of inner-city smog, conveniently branded red, gold and yellow in a slurry of interdependent conceit. A mass-produced line of quasi-communistic spirit, shoved senseless within an ornate red envelope branded with symbols of luck and whore, conveniently placed within arm's distance of a burnt-out firecracker and an unsteady hit of Fentanyl, ready to sell or consume. Surely, an ancient mechanism designed to forget and impress, because as any good Chinese man knows, family always comes first, and when your dying relative collapses at your knees, vomiting coagulated semen in a patriotic display of sex and fervour. That's when you know you've made it.

Colorful displays of neon lights and piccadilly extravagance shrouded the back draw of the twisted forgotten lanes harbouring The Town, leading us discretely towards our destination of food and patched slavery. And the more we squabbled in polarising ferverence, the more we assimilated into the smells, riches and eventual homeostasis of local chicken stock, plagued weary with the granularity of Grandpa's cigarette ash, fresh from the noodle shop next door ...or was it grasping me from the sewer below, astew with soiled ginger shavings, discarded opium and an unidentifiable delicacy designed only for the fine China stolen by generation's past. Thankfully, we were only one last meal away from finding out, as our view widened and our sense of place vanished into a cold dark room of orbital apprehension. Our adventure had only just begun.

"I too wanted to become a writer once," the editor blurted, as if making some kind of ultimate sacrifice against his own will to speak, pushing his way through the plastic beads designed to keep foreigners out.

"But I figured the money was better on the other side of the fence. You know, where the prairie sits. The prairie, dude! I'm absolutely killin' it with these metaphors!"

<!-- Chinese Restaurant - Arrival and Ordering -->

The dull eggshell greys on the dilapidated walls of the Chinese outlook (suitably named, The Ming) drew a sense of brooding as I stepped through the battered corridor and into the bright fluorescent glaze of an oriental mental ward, padded with the comestible muck of a harmless flammable odour used solely for manufacturing purposes. The laminate rows of chair and table confounded the general sense of space it was attempting to inhabit, juxtaposed against the depleted faces of a trodden theatre affair, now racing frantically eradicate all sense of honorable atmosphere as part of a grand, self-serving pursuit of cathartic, emotional absolution. Only time would reveal the truth of the reality we were witnessing here today, hinted by the shockingly empty response our waiter deposited, as she guided us to our booth at the back far corner of the asylum.

The booth itself comfortably sat three, an necessary arrangement to comfortably situate the Editor's ego, driven mad by the delicate tension of an unforgiving racist and his gook-inspired raciee. He of course insisted on sitting on the cushioned fabric below, because apparently even the thought of asking for my opinion was simply too much to conflate. Take, steal and murder at any cost, no matter what the injury or crime, and be sure to gather the receipt come tax time to assure your place on Mr. Ming's throne. Perhaps it was simple American policy to be an asshole. In fact, I was almost certain of it.

"Listen, I know you think I'm not the BRIGHTEST guy, but you know, I'm more a connections kind of man. A Wowser. Fantastic bloody connections, I'd say" the editor remarked, unintentionally resolute in the valium-infused confines of a sedated cliche.

"So do you like the book?" I retorted, keen to hear what misaligned innocence could be extracted from the two useless lumps of flesh surrounding his open-closey thingy. At this stage I'd doubted whether he even had the capacity to read at all, as he confidently placed his hands behind his head, nearly knocking over a priceless Qing dynasty vase. It was like witnessing a stray deer run from it's prey, gasping at it's lungs in residual safety, only to be shot in the head by a lone ranger with far too much time on his hands. All in a day's work.

"I think it has potential, kid," who in a momentary relapse of bad faith, revealed himself as an incapacitated five-year-old before snapping back into his adult form, remaining cautiously silent as per the contract he'd maintained with the five mile dead-zone preoccupying his brain.

"Although I have to say, just between you and me, some of the things you write about make me feel real uneasy. Like, what the hell even is a 'putty intention'? Is it some weird sexual thing, because you know I steer clear of that weird stuff."

"I mean, I gue..."

"Hey, waiter! Where are the dumps at! Yo. I'm just kidding, although I would really appreciate a fresh menu. This one smells like chicken grease. Oh, and two seltzer waters please! It's like I'm tryin' throat-fuck a sauna in here." Only he would have the audacity to confuse verbal harassment for the outline of excellent customer service. He even insisted that the waiter stand silently by on some kind of overtime distress call, as he scanned through the menu with the hobbling glower of a dying senior.

"Let's see. I will have the 6-piece pork dumpling set, a chicken n' corn soup and uhh, could I please also have a serving of Singapore noodles. They're real Singapore noodles, right?"

The waiter, the holy accolade of Mr. Ming himself, exercised a compendium of boredom in the broken English she repeated in direct contempt of the editor's culinary sacrilege which trod on a level of disrespect and treachery that transcended almost all cultural and social boundaries. Certainly, I doubt the restaurant owners enjoyed their daughter being harassed by a mid-aged white sock, an over-worked Mr. Ming caught standing in the corner of the ward, cautiously eyeing his customers and their presence, to the deep sighs of a sous-chef cutting slabs of a pork into thinly-sliced bundles of coy. Noodle in. Noodle out. Break a hand and shut the fuck up. I was ready to order.

"I think I'll have the..."

"So junior, tell me about this book then. Are we talkin' fantasy? I mean, I don't remember readin' about no goblins or nuthin', but it seems a bit out there if you know what I mean," muttered the editor mid prawn cracker, as he threw his menu onto the table beside him, completely unaware that I had yet to order anything from Mr. Ming's consortium of unidentified protein products. At this point I was equally as hungry as I was keen to have him tied to a bench and water tortured, although realising my cake had already been spat, trampled and fuck on, it was clear misery module located conveniently via in a slot in my skull had already suppressed my appetite, now programmed to endure whatever existing attrition was being held against my soul.

"I suppose I would describe it as story which takes you through the thoughts and interactions of a character who violently degrades to a point of complete destitution," I answered, ready to endure a concise refraction of meaningless assault.

"You know I don't do fantasy, right? That sounds like some weird Tolkein shit. You know, I'm all about the human story. I'm a man of feeling and I love hot integrity pieces."

For sparse moment we both stared at each other, like two brothers who hadn't quite met before. Although we both knew what we wanted, maybe we'd reached a point of where we were both too old to truly understand each other. At the very least, I knew that I'd had enough of his antics and aside from literally grabbing my spoon and shoving it into his eye before skull-fucking him, I squeezed my lips and held on tightly to the anger and frustration that was desperately trying to release itself into the world.

"I don't think this is going to work out," I murmured, hand on my bag, ready to engage in a prison-break of fury, only to be interrupted by the waiter carrying plates full of hot, steaming food, fresh from the packet. And although it clearly felt like a bad-date gone worse, it also felt a bit like a bad break up, between yin and yang's relative domains. For a few moments he sat there, perhaps overcome by his own  crushing morality, confused by today's outcome. In fact, I'm not quite sure how he felt, as he sat there in relative silence, breaking into his Singapore noodles and gobbling up the rasher twins' lesser cousins, in an all-out homicide of culinary scorched-earth. All I knew was that the mood had soured and something vulnerable had touched his inner-human, as he broke down sobbing into the billowing steam of oyster-sauce particulate and inconsequential urine.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry," he said, with bits of noodle stuck to his face, like a child's mural gone horribly wrong.

"I need this job. I really fucking do. Fuck. I'm on last strings buddy. You don't know how badly I need this. They're going to fire me, I know it, unless if I can... I promise I'll try harder, okay!?" As far as I was concerned, it wasn't a matter of effort, so much as it was a matter of incompatibility, and although he knew it too, I wasn't keen on teaching a dead dog new tricks. The plain insincerity on the walls, now shifting it's muted colours into a dark purple, served as a sore reminder not to address the poor yupie trying his best to remain sober on a Wednesday.

"I just don't think you get it," carried the words into the hollow cavern of his brain, now attempting to recruit a gallow of well-trained monkeys to decipher the ploy of sabotage being hurled his way. The mean man of intellectual steel, burning himself on



It's almost as if you didn't even read the book,

"What, are you calling me stupid?" retorted the Italian barbarism he sought as a defensive mechanism against all means of life.

"Does it even make a difference?"

At this point, I was certain he'd finally crumble and return back into the pit of magma from which he formed. Scheming in delicate ways

"What if I told you that


The cheque came squalid



<!-- Restaurant Leave -->

As walked out of the Ming restaurant, indifferent to these grease-ridden lanes, plastered many times over with a volcanic certainty of cheap glue and holographic print, all I could feel were the tip of my knees as they sank ever-so silently into the mound of my socks. Like a slow-tide of faithlessness being dragged back into reef, it was the kind of thing that would always unanimously end in a public cheer of despondence, gurgled in the mass-hysteria of the death of an enemy.
