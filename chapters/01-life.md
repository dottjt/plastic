Welcome to life.

<!-- Editor Interaction -->

A rancid fascination of all things particular. A floundering point of asymptotic reference, crown jewel to the unjustified misery we all pretend to understand. Careless in it's motion, thrust vague through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning in agony at the avaricious nature of the show. A rag-doll daddy of putty intentions, spluttered viscous into the cultural misappropriation you will witness before you. This is where all stories begin, end and...

"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room as he swivels his chair towards me in a hesitant gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, dawdling frantic on a child's notepad in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and cheese biscuits.

"I really, really liked what you did there. I thought it was simply fantastic! The imagery. The sex appeal. I can definitely fuck that, if you know what I mean."

Naturally, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. Although I suppose it was the level of respect I garnered as an unknown assailant, possibly attached to his meaningless words like a guerilla war I was voluntarily being subject to. He, the raved lunatic of a fatherless circle-jerk, head of the New n' Improved Mickey Mouse Club, accent dripped-thick in ancient tar like a dead Italian over his heartless-sleeves, was reassured only by the brash exterior of a three-hour Tony Robbins lecture he once saw the thumbnail of on the internet. And myself, a clash between the unsettling intentions revealing themselves in the feint colonies of raw-sweat rippling in arcade through my skin. I couldn't have been more uncomfortable.

"You know, have you ever considered writing this, uh, material into a book? I think it would make for fascinating reading."

"Well yeah, that's basically why I'm here. To get my book published," sat a very sad man preoccupied in my chair, conveniently puzzled at the present-day theatrics of his outreach.

An entire lifetime of small talk and faux pleasantries had transpired since my arrival to Dante's luster-luck fuck-pen of ill-conceived entertainment, and it felt like we were getting nowhere. My hand reaches for the mug o' water conveniently placed next to the picture of a young child, dressed rather sexually in a cheerleader's outfit, presumably "Daddy's girl" as the editor might put it. Even my throat can taste the insolence of this man, the lukewarm liquid trickling in solid motion down my throat, never to be described again. His deadbeat practice. The gore in his heart. At one point I thought he was even trying to sell me a phone plan. In contemporary fashion I attempt to sigh, moan, possibly gasp in complete awe, before bringing my smile to a full, unmatched forte. I could tell even he was getting agitated.

"Hey, it's officially coming to twelve o' clock. You know, there's this great Chinese place down the road? I mean, you're Chinese right? You just have that gook look to you, no offense or nuthin."

Sure. There's nothing offensive about being unadultered scum, perked upright like a pantomine piece of shit. Ah, who even cares.

<!-- Editor Office Description -->

It was a scuffle trying to leave the office, what with the array of clutter begging me to stay and become part of the decor. From the cruft wall-flower wallpaper to the reocurring stains which revealed themselves in everything. Mould had become somewhat of a fashion statement. It was as if being transported back to a different time, rife with scandal and Nixon fever. A complementary



<!-- Chinatown Observation -->

I suppose Chinatown is the same everywhere you go. Unadorned paper lanterns slathered in the embrace of inner-city smog, held thinly together by a frail network of cheaply imported steel. Chinatown truly is a convenient taste of quasi-communism branded as this season's flavour of MSG, enveloped in a bowl of fake candy to bless the children's ward with. Hell, you can smell the chicken stock from a mile away, infused in quantum with the leftover remains of cigarette ash.

There was one particular lady who caught my eye. She was wearing this gorgeous fur-coat, freshly killed
