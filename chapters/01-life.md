<!-- Editor and Character Introduction - precariously -->

Welcome to life. A rancid fascination of all things particular. An overwhelming sense of asymptotic reference. America's rag-doll daddy of putty intentions, spluttered viscous into the cultural misappropriation you witness before your very eyes. This is where all stories begin, end and...

"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room as he swivels his chair towards my general direction. Hesitant in a gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, mouth struck-brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares. Only crumbs were left of the star-mangled biscuits, presumably store-bought for our excited listeners at home. Dwadling frantic on a notepad fit suitably for a 90s' Nickelodeon pre-teen, he was the mindless operator who would introduce himself as my only lifeline into the world of publishing, and I was the pathetic liar who intended to milk his acquaintance for all it was worth.

"I really, really liked what you did there. I thought it was simply fantastic! The imagery. The sex appeal. I could definitely fuck that, if you know what I mean."

Naturally, I wasn't quite sure what he meant. Was it a generous expression of misplaced animosity? Was it the beginning of what was to become a laborious online prank, where I, the unwitting idiot, were to be exposed as some part-time celebrity on a popular Japanese game show? Perhaps it was the result of a fatherless upbringing, rushed illiterate through a delinquent craze of conservative vice-chancellery and ethnic malfeasance, deep from within the backwaters of a clandestine women's society keen on beating the fluff out of potato to prove it's self-worth in the inter-continental submission of 3rd world delight. Sure, I'd probably fuck it too. Me and my words, dressed in mortal calamity, blind in an unfortunate sexual encounter involving my last moments in an exploding orgasm, and a terribly shy lackey with a syllable for a grin.

Although I suppose it was the level of respect I garnered as an unknown assailant, possibly attached to his meaningless gestures delivered haphazardly like the illegitimate leader of an unknown guerilla war. Che guevara au lite, the raved lunatic of a ritual patriarchal circle-jerk, head o' the New an' Improved Mickey Mouse Club, accent dripped-thick in the ancient tar of a dead Italian laid limp over his heartless sleeves and into the repeating glares of purgatory. A cursory sanctuary for two-time real estate agents and doofus car salesmen to worship the enumeration of thy poor. He was a man reassured by the might and glory of a three-hour Tony Robbins lecture once witnessed in full three-minute summary, cantankerously basked in a level of self-gratification not last seen since the Holy Roman Empire. Then across the border, sitting awkwardly by the wayside behind a facade of U.N. sponsored barbed-wire, enclosed within the prevailing attitudes and echoing dialogue showering me in a vindictive tempest of sparkling doubt, was me. An unruly clash against the unsettling intentions revealing themselves in the feint colonies of pop-sweat rippling through the arcade of my skin. I couldn't have been more uncomfortable, nor under-represented in this fraudulent battering of intellectual deceit. But I assured myself that everything would be okay as long as I continued to embrace the sodomy in full. Thankfully, Aristotle was blasphemous.

"You know, have you ever considered writing this, uh, material into a book? I think it would make for fascinating reading."

"Well yeah, that's basically why I'm here. To get my book published," sat an audaciously sad man preoccupied firmly in this chair, helplessly situated in an uncaught mire of time, conveniently puzzled at the present-day theatrics of this man's somewhat infectious outreach. Soon an entire lifetime of smalltalk and faux pleasantries would transpire in my head, capturing me in arrival at Dante's fuck-pen of ill-conceived trickery. And in the wisp that followed from his dry words nailing my jaw to the hardwood floors below, it was obvious we were getting nowhere in this play of malaligned rivalry. He wanted to see himself in everything, and I simply wanted to be acknowledged, loved and possibly adjourned like a house cat on trial for dragging a dead, mutilated creature into the living room during a heated bout of Friday night football.

I decided to reach for the mug o' water conveniently placed next to the picture of a scantily-dressed child in tight cheerleader's seduce, presumably reared to have the words "Daddy's girl" tattooed on her forehead before being fucked in front of an eager camera-crew and a live internet audience of millions. Yakuza's finest. And as the lukewarm liquid trickled down my throat, even my basic bodily functions could sense the paltry desperation of this poor man's attempt at azure, developing itself into the middle-aged caricature of a homeless veteran deep-throating his prized roadkill for the thrill of the violence. His deadbeat practice. The filament of gore that shone like a piercing light through his frail heart. I attempt to let out a deep sigh before bringing my smile to a full, unmatched forte.

"It's fast approaching twelve and I'd kill for a bite. You like Chinese? You're Chinese, right? I mean, you just have that slight gook look to you, no offense, cutter." Sure. Nothing offensive about wish-washing the unadulterated scum out of my life. You pantomime sack of shit. I've scraped less-abrasive gunk from the self-mutilated pussy of a dead-hooker's final stand at a crack-clinic shootout than I've spent today, hearing you mutter the two-ounce garbage tract of poorly-spoken English you claim is wholly integral to the left side of your brain. Ah, who even cares anymore. I'm sure his wanton style was just the kind of tautological caprice required to turn heads and kick books into the wounded hands of yesteryear's consumer. The kind of frolic that apparently, readers desperately want to fuck.

<!-- Editor Office Description -->

Attempting to leave the office was a frivolous scruffle of hard tactics and self-determination. Between wades of paper stacked chronologically in ways that would leave the physically handicapped in existential crisis, and what seemed like a fossilized pocket of methane from the Mesozoic period, left only enough oxygen in a tightly-concealed vacuum of quantum necessity, designed cunningly for the efficient gills of literary agents and editors alike. Merciless like a Catholic choir of addled school children singing the Church's most forbidden hymn, inconspicuous hoards of office stationary and clutter surrounded me in a wildfire of nomadic appeal, begging me to stay and offer my soul to the lord of decor sitting idly by in a chromatic tone of poncy green. From the cruft wallpaper of prissy rhododendrons, to the reoccurring stains which revealed themselves as Tommy and Russ, nothing felt untarnished, nor logically brave in this maze of unknown recollection. Even the mould from within the dark archival corners of the building had gained somewhat of a celebrity status, occupied within the presence of old writer's manuscripts from the early 1800s'. A haughty Machiavellian ruse, as the editor liked to put it. His eyes now caught on the large indecent apertures of 136 Brightridge Avenue and it's quivering hinge back into the grasp of mainstream discourse. Following what seemed like an eternity with the world's worst therapist, it was nice to once again reacquaint myself with the smack, shovel and bang of these mean city streets. If only to feel that little bit closer to me.

<!-- Scene 2 START -->

<!-- Chinatown Observation -->

Chinatown is the same everywhere you go. Unadorned paper lanterns slathered in the inner-city embrace of particulate smog, carelessly branded in a patriotic slurry of interdependent conceit and uncanny menstruation. The colours of red and a cast-iron yellow, fucked and dribbled along an autistic array of blinding nationalism. A mass-produced line of chauvinistic spirit, shoved senseless within an ornate red-envelope raffishly stamped with symbols of luck and whore. Conveniently placed within arm's distance of a burnt-out firecracker and an unsteady hit of Fentanyl. An ancient mechanism designed to forget and impress, because as any good Chinaman worth his weight in Tang dynasty gold knows, family and tradition always come first. And when your dying relative collapses at your knees, vomiting coagulated semen in a patriotic display of sex and fervour, that's when you know you've truly made it as a father and son of the People's Republic of China.

Colorful displays of neon lights and piccadilly extravagance shrouded the backdraw of the twisted lanes of Chinatwon, harbouring the forgotten faces and contorted postures defying anatomy in the hauling duck-fat laid behind. Leading us towards our stranded destination of food and decontamination. Heated in a squabble of polarising contention, it soon became apparent to our fundamental being that the very foundation of our fibrous existence was being annexed into the smells and riches of our landscape. Grandma's chicken stock, plagued weary amidst the granular undertones of Grandpa's cigarette ash. Served in an impure confederation of tripe and blood jelly. A cloud of billowing steam engulfs a bamboo chorus of squeamish roe, twisting and wrying in a undulating scream of mass extinction. I can feel it grasping at my lungs amongst a hidden stew of fermented ginger, tempered opium and kibbled rat hair, bubbling in wretched torment within the sewerage pipes below. A fatal delicacy most workers simply could not afford. Supple hastings, my friend, as our our view widened into a precarious shade of white, and our sense of place vanished into a cold dark room of orbital apprehension.

"I too wanted to become a writer once," the editor blurted, as if making some kind of ultimate sacrifice against his own will.

"But I figured the money was better on the other side of the fence. You know? And man, fuck all that writing. I couldn't think of anything worse." Although certain in what I heard, I wasn't quite sure how to respond, let alone comprehend the complete destruction of the English language as I knew it within a brief passing moment, as I pushed through the plastic beads designed to keep his ugly type out.

<!-- Chinese Restaurant - Arrival and Ordering -->

The muted Tudor frizzle of the dilapidated walls enclosing the Chinese palace (suitably named, The Ming) drew a sense of familial brooding as I stepped through the battered corridors and into the bright fluorescent gaze of an oriental mental ward. The laminate rows of chairs and tables confounded the general sense of space it attempted to immitate, juxtaposed against the depleted faces of a trodden theatre affair, now racing frantically to eradicate all sense of pride and honor as part of a grand self-serving pursuit of cathartic emotional absolution. Only time would reveal the truth to our witness, presupposed only by the shockingly empty response we received from our waiter's distilled face, as she guided us to our booth in the far back corner of the asylum.

The booth itself comfortably sat three, a necessary arrangement to accomodate for the timely addition of the editor's ego, a six-foot mirage resembling the entire backbench of Republican majority senate, driven mad by the delicate tension of an unforgiving racist and his gook-inspired raciee. Much to his character, he blatantly insisted on sitting his gargantuan ass on the cushioned fabric of the revered corner seat, because apparently the idea of anything less would have been considered treason. Rape, steal and murder at any cost, and be sure to gather the receipt come tax time to assure your place on Mr. Ming's throne. Perhaps it was American policy to be an asshole. I was almost certain of it.

"Listen, I know you think I'm not the BRIGHTEST guy, but you know, I'm more a connections kind of man. A Wowser. Fantastic bloody connections, I'd say," the editor remarked, unintentionally resolute in the valium-infused confines of a sedated cliche.

"So do you like the book?", I retorted, keen to hear what misaligned innocence could be extracted from the two useless lumps of flesh surrounding his open-closey thingy. At this point, I doubted whether he even had the capacity to read at all, as he confidently placed his hands behind his head, nearly knocking a priceless imperial vase off it's edge. It was like witnessing a stray deer run from it's prey, gasping in relief in the residual safety it had finally earnt, only to be shot in the head by a lone ranger with a fine taste for Midwest Whitetail. All in a day's work.

"I think it has potential, kid," the editor replies, who in a momentary relapse of bad faith, revealed himself as an incapacitated child with a strong desire for mother's milk, before snapping back into his encrusted adult form, remaining cautiously silent as per the dubious contract he'd maintained under the five-mile dead-zone preoccupying his brain.

"Although I must say, there's some really disturbin' shit in there. Putty intentions? What the fuck is that? Is it some kind of weird sexual thing you people are into, because you know I don't publish that stuff."

"I mean, I gue..."

"Hey, waiter! Where are the dumps at! I'm just kiddin', although I would really appreciate a fresh menu. This one smells like chicken, or some shit. Oh, and two seltzer waters please! The bubbly stuff. Man, it's like tryin' throat-fuck a sauna in here!" Only he would have the audacity to confuse verbal harassment with the extravagant excellence of five-star customer service, as an ode to the millions of telemarkers makin' dime sellin' faulty car insurance to reckless youth with a mandatory requirement for debt spending. He even insisted that the waiter stand silently by, ink to be dispersed at any moment in an inexplicable rage of Chinese cursive, as he scanned through the menu with the hobbling globber of a dying senior in the midst of cardiac arrest. What truly perplexed me most was how the editor had managed to turn so suddenly against me, or had I simply been naive? Perhaps it was just what I'd become accustomed to, another cunder to be punt. Chew edis.

"Let's see. I will have the 6-piece pork dumpling set, a chicken n' corn soup and uhh, could I please also have a large serving of Singapore noodle! They're real Singapore noodles, right?"

Miss. waiter, the holy accolade of Mr. Ming himself, exercised a compendium of boredom in the broken English she repeated in direct contempt towards the editor, which trod on a level of disrespect which transcended all meaningful social boundaries. Certainly, I doubt the restaurant owners enjoyed their daughter being harassed by a mid-aged white sock, as a plesantly over-worked Mr. Ming stood cautiously in the corner of the ward on guard duty, eyeing his customer's every intent. The deep sighs of the underpaid sous-chef butchering slabs of a glazed pork into thinly-sliced bundles of coy, only adding to the tension. Noodle in. Noodle out. Break a hand and call me Gonzo. I was ready to order.

"I think I'll have the..."

"So junior, tell me about this book then. Are we talkin' fantasy? I mean, I don't remember readin' about no goblins or nuthin'", muttered the editor mid prawn-cracker, as he threw his menu onto the table beside him. Completely unaware that I had yet to order anything from Mr. Ming's consortium of unidentified protein eschew. If only I had a gun and an incessant desire to kill Italians, then we could end this scene in a wok full of limbs and cheap hair gel. At this point I was equally as hungry as I was keen to have him tied to a bench and water tortured, although realising my cake had already been spat on, trampled and fucked on, it was clear I'd already delegated my mind to the misery module located conveniently via in a PCI slot in my skull. A dozy appetite suppressant, now programmed to endure whatever existing attrition was being held against my soul.

"Well editor, I can call you that, right? I suppose I would describe it as story which takes you through the thoughts and interactions of a character who violently degrades to a point of complete destitution," I answered, ready to endure a concise refraction of meaningless assault.

"That sounds a lot like fantasy to me. You know I don't do fantasy, right? I'm personally all about the human story. Can you come back to me with that?"

For sparse moment we both stared at each other like two brothers who hadn't quite met before. Maybe we were simply too old, too bothered in our own ways to truly want to understand each other. And aside from literally grabbing my spoon and shoving it into his eye, there was little I could do to contain the anger and frustration that had constructed itself to a point of

"This isn't going to work out," I murmured in a tight-lipped outburst, hand on my bag, ready to engage in an unplanned prison-break, only to be interrupted by Miss. waiter carrying blue-laced bowls full of hot, steaming food. For a few moments he sat there, overcome by his own crushing morality, confused at the very fate which he had sealed with his own two hands. Well, I wasn't quite sure how he felt, as he sat there in relative silence, breaking his fork into the viridian shimmer of his Singapore noodles, gobblin' up the rasher twins' lesser cousins in an all-out homicide of culinary scorched-earth. All I knew was that the mood had soured into a guava pulp of rotten aspirations, held down following by a violent clash with his own worst vulnerabilities, as he broke down sobbing into the piffling steam of urinated oyster-sauce and bipartisan sacrilege.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry," cried the editor, with bits of noodle stuck to his face.

"I need this job. I really fucking do. Fuck. I'm on last strings buddy. You don't know how badly I need this. They're going to fire me, I know it. I can give you anything you want, you have to work with me dude." His cheek-bones bore the pity of a decrepit widow, held together by a chain of cigarettes which kept those ol' lungs pretty. We were two incompatible fuck-buddies, with a schedule which barely fit in enough time to spent with our wives. He saw red and I saw yellow. And although he knew it too, I wasn't keen on teaching a dead dog new tricks. The plain insincerity of the flaked-walls shifted their muted colours into a dark purple of valiant rose, drawing the poor yupie into a fifth-week of sobriety.

"I just don't think you get it. It's almost as if you didn't even read the book," I announced, personally hand-crafting my words in such a way that they would eventually reach the hollow cavern of his brain, now attempting to recruit a gallow of well-trained monkeys to decipher the ploy of sabotage being hurled his way.

"What, are you calling me stupid?", retorted the barbaric child, a defensive mechanism sought to eradicate all means of life.

"Does it even make a difference?"

Certainly, he didn't have any answers. No way to win. No way to express how little control he had over the situation. No way to charm or linger in

At this point, I was certain he'd finally crumble and return back into the pit of magma from which he formed, although the entropy was unlikely. I lifted myself from the table and walked away.


<!-- Restaurant Leave -->

As walked out of the Ming restaurant, indifferent to these grease-ridden lanes, plastered many times over with a volcanic certainty of cheap glue and holographic print, all I could feel were the tip of my knees as they sank ever-so silently into the mound of my socks. Like a slow-tide of faithlessness being dragged back into reef, it was the kind of thing that would always unanimously end in a public cheer of despondence, gurgled in the mass-hysteria of the death of an enemy.
