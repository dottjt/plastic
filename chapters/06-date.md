## Scene 1 START

### Arrival at her apartment

Blah. Blah. Blah. Twirple. Twerp. Smitten, hee. Barmy. Larmy. Surple. Cat-anya. Slosh. Plum. Sempre. Empire. Oh. Empire? Zanana. Tempelio. Adarsh. Fremisimo. Palundius. Mant. Cultun. Splatoot. Natura. Nervous. Excited. Quaint.

I felt sick. My heart wretched tight. My eyes tumbled around in violent hurl of breakfast. My immediate vicinity a mere outline of dissolved potential. Shapes mimicing bread crust. Explosions of yeast in my stomach. I accidentally bump into a child with a flower crown. She dies. Her entire body splits in half, snapping her frame in two. The screaming is unbearable. It is like choking on ice. I attempt to run away, but the relativity pulls me back, forcing the adrenaline through my tears. I begin touching myself uncontrollably. I just want to be me.

I arrived at the street of plenty, embalmed in a couldron of anxiety. Umbrella in hand, happy to appear relevant in this giant boardgame of a neighbourhood. Perhaps I'll be mugged today by a giant elf with pointy ears. I walked my way along each house, appreciation the community of tall wall-bearing ceilings 


 and cracked walls, relished by the old tin roofs archivist love to

 The northern end of town. Old brick houses,



 A wholesome exchange of flavoured tinnitus, sneaking itself scalloped into the vice of your dreams.



<!-- I think the theme I want for this chapter is that the character has forgotten all about her. -->

Milo, who leaning back in her extendible office chair on her desk, decorated in thigh-high knitted socks which continued into the outskirts of a pink-lace pantyhose, seemed like the only sane person in the room.

"Well, aren't ya gonna come in an' fuck me?"

## Scene 2 START

### Sodomy monologue

There's something fantastic about sodomy. A religious travesty of heightened caution, no different to blowing up a entire school bus full of Indonesian school children, limbs akimbo, crisp sheets of trigonometry pouring down in a cascade of ceremony, only to condemn those who practice formal expression in a much, much less formal way.

"You really are evil, aren't you?" says Milo, skipping about on the side walk, a-twirl in her own world of disturbing imagination of primary fascination. A curious beast I one-day hoped to tame and unleash, like a feel-good tsunami of sexual domination. Clearly, you didn't need to hear that.

"It's just a joke," I remarked, a light teaser of things to come, hoping to sound lost in my own intellectuality, obviously inundated in an air of desperation I'd simply accepted as the lonely cousin following me around everywhere.

### Walk down the promenade

The harbor atmosphere, caulked in the silhouette of a family galore, witnessing a domestic episode of "dad knows best", was suitably romantic, if not a touch endearing. As I looked up at the night sky, it was clear that the clouds were amiss in their treachery, shrouding their eerie ways into the whispering wind and creeping shadows, lurking and melding themselves into our fragmented movement refracting against the crayon river below. Thankfully it was just enough to convince her to hold my hand, something which I'd been thinking about since we first met.

Milo looked at me with wide-open eyes, tautologically drawing the outline of my torso with her tongue slithered between her teeth, incommensurable in her indecision she treated like a cute afterthought. I could never quite tell what it was she was scheming, nor whom with. But it felt awfully as if I were being plucked from the herd for my blatant gullibility, a trait which I heralded as a quirky coping mechanism to be admired, now sinking me in a latrine of quibble speculation.

I'd always been afraid of this moment, where man meets women, carried by the heavy hands of fate onto something greater. Where the expectation was loud and vast, ripping itself methodologically into the grain of your skin, scolding bone as a consequence of childish demeanor.

"Very funny," I noted in extreme caution, knowing full-well that there was a 1 in 10 chance that her flirtatious actions could result in a round of heated bathroom sex, unfortunate for the disabled sod in a 60s' wheel chair holding on for dear life to the ambient noise of sexual wear n' tear.





// maybe speak about how the chemistry had somewhat died.

like tryin' ta squash Lego into squelched antelope. The world's smallest tongue, preaching a woman's biggest nightmare.

### At Bar

There's a particular mistress in every bar.

Clashed against the senses,

In a deafening reverberation of broken noise, the singing cheers and alcoholic folly of the bar left open a new a generation of patrons to falter and despair, clashing slovenly against the senses in an agonising huff of futility. It was clear who had become adjusted to the rein, those blacked out youth in their cordoroy t-shirts and labelled affair, justifying confidence with another stint at the bar. A drunken man swerves around me, smashing his head into the Irish trims lacing their way around the liquor tetrohedron of doom.

"Man, where do they find these women," I shout, knowing full-well that no one can hear me. I see Milo head to the bar, flirting with the waitress, before turning her head towards me with sharp smirk and a brief sneer in her eye, as if to suggest that I had some part to play

I always felt out of place at bars. Not that it felt artificial, but it's not the kind of place you would live in, so why would you want to hang out there?

Milo comes over with two pints of cider and a

I can feel her grabbing at my pants. It was wild.
