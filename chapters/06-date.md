## Scene 1 START

### Arrival at her apartment

Blah. Blah. Blah. Twirple. Twerp. Twat. Surrrpple. Schlop. Slosh. Barmy. Larmy. Plum. Sempre. Empire. Oh. Empire? Zanana. Tempelio. Adarsh. Fremisimo. Palundius. Mant. Cultun. Splatoot. Eippal. Wzender. Mollat. Cat-anya. Howwel. Venner. Natura. Nervous. Excited. Quaint.

I felt sick. Heart wretched tight. Eyes tumbled violent. A hurl of mirage. Tenderised. Stripped. Breakfast. A sidewalk of sausage. Mahogany. Fuck. My immediate vicinity. A mere outline of dissolved potential. Shapes n' sounds. Our friendly dynamic duplicit dynamo duality duo. That's right. That's right. That's right! Pow! Wow! OMG!? The bread. The butter. My mouth. An explosion of yeast. Rumbling through my stomach. Beautiful boy. Lovely Liam. Teeth like corroded rubber. I accidentally bump into a child with a medicinal flower crown. She dies in an expiry of shame. Her entire body. Snapping in half. Splitting her delicate frame in two. Her stupid moronic screaming. An unbearable dither of lousy attention-seeking bullshit. It is like choking on ice. Fuck her life. I attempt to run away, but the relativity pulls me back. Tear tearing the torn tear you tatter tit tome. I begin touching myself uncontrollably. I just want to be. Let me be me. Be me be. Let.

It was dark. I'd just arrived at the street of plenty. Embalmed in a couldron of anxiety. Umbrella in hand. Happy to appear relevant in this giant boardgame of neighbourhood. Perhaps I'll be mugged today by a giant elf with pointy ears, a precious reminder to always wield magic. I walked my way along each house, appreciative of the Victorian terrace walls and their avid continuity. Supporting the Edwardian ceilings stolen, cracked and relished by the rusted tin roofs engulfed in common ivy. Born from the accolade of mismatch furniture which sat outside on the timber front porch, hosting parties for the meek and well-deserved. I pictured Milo being fucked on the worn leather of the cream couch in the front lawn of her sharehouse, faded in op-shop sweater, holding a beer now being ravaged from her arms as the man pinned her down and showed her pleasure. The front door was no better. I'm sure there was a glory hole somewhere, as I geared myself for a wholesome exchange of flavoured tinnitus, ready to impress her paper-thin waist with a good ol' whack-a-moleay of thy peen.

I ring the doorbell and wait. Damn, I probably should have just called her instead. I hear erratic footsteps. Then a thud. The door opens and a girl with pink hair bursts out in an exorbitant display of giddy laughter, before falling to floor in a heave of gasping panic. She stops. She turns and looks up at me with a daint smile of incapacitated charm, licking her lips playfully, as if to reminder herself that her lips were even there. Definitely the kind of girl who encouraged date rape to overcoming the awkwardness of actually expressing herself. I step over her body and into the hallway. She could be fucked later. I turn an immediate right, where I find Milo leaning extensibly on the Kitchen bench, decorated in thigh-high knitted socks, which continue into the outskirts of a pink-lace pantyhose. Seemingly, the only sane person in this entire house. Well, that was until I witnessed her take out, as well as reinsert a used tampon in front of my very eyes. Perhaps we were already married.

"How's it going, stranger?", she signalled, passing me a sedated wink of comical desire, as she struggled to pull her leggings up. Admittedly, standing here in this room, I felt undecided about her existence. It was neither a feel of abhorrence, nor attraction. Only a failure to recognise why I was truly here, conflict against the fantasy I had upheld of her stature for so incredibly long. Chances were that I simply didn't want to recognise the grotesque husk of flea-infested cum standing in front of me, reeking of a black tar which even fracking itself could not produce. And yet, as I abhored her, I was reminded of the fact that she was simply a female version of me, and arguably I simply hated myself. Then it occurred to me that I simply didn't have the courage to approach my own desperation and loneliness beyond the women I threw myself at, if only to create the impression that I was worth at least someone's attention. Hopefully, she would let me hold her hand.

"Not too bad. I bumped into your friend at the door, are they going to be okay? I think she's on the front patio, laughing at a ladybug." She seemed unconcerned.

"Oh yeah. It's only Ketamine. She's been on it twice a week now for quite a while now, so I would say she's safe." An expert opinion an expert soul. Welcome to reality, where nothing makes sense and everyone around you whoring for that wonderful fuck-stick of disgression.

She lights up a cigarette, strutting towards me. Exhaling before kissing me on the lips. She curls her leg around mine, kicking my excitement into full-gear as the relevancy became relevant. The light was here and it was my time to shine.

"What do you say we head to the city? My shout."

## Scene 2 START

### Sodomy monologue

There's something fantastic about sodomy. A religious travesty of heightened caution, no different to blowing up a entire school bus full of Indonesian school children, limbs akimbo, crisp sheets of trigonometry pouring down in a cascade of ceremony, only to condemn those who practice formal expression in a much, much less formal way.

"You really are evil, aren't you?" says Milo, skipping about on the side walk, a-twirl in her own world of disturbing imagination of primary fascination. A curious beast I one-day hoped to tame and unleash, like a feel-good tsunami of sexual domination. Clearly, you didn't need to hear that.

"It's just a joke," I remarked, a light teaser of things to come, hoping to sound lost in my own intellectuality, obviously inundated in an air of desperation I'd simply accepted as the lonely cousin following me around everywhere.

### Walk down the promenade

The harbor atmosphere, caulked in the silhouette of a family galore, witnessing a domestic episode of "dad knows best", was suitably romantic, if not a touch endearing. As I looked up at the night sky, it was clear that the clouds were amiss in their treachery, shrouding their eerie ways into the whispering wind and creeping shadows, lurking and melding themselves into our fragmented movement refracting against the crayon river below. Thankfully it was just enough to convince her to hold my hand, something which I'd been thinking about since we first met.

Milo looked at me with wide-open eyes, tautologically drawing the outline of my torso with her tongue slithered between her teeth, incommensurable in her indecision she treated like a cute afterthought. I could never quite tell what it was she was scheming, nor whom with. But it felt awfully as if I were being plucked from the herd for my blatant gullibility, a trait which I heralded as a quirky coping mechanism to be admired, now sinking me in a latrine of quibble speculation.

I'd always been afraid of this moment, where man meets women, carried by the heavy hands of fate onto something greater. Where the expectation was loud and vast, ripping itself methodologically into the grain of your skin, scolding bone as a consequence of childish demeanor.

"Very funny," I noted in extreme caution, knowing full-well that there was a 1 in 10 chance that her flirtatious actions could result in a round of heated bathroom sex, unfortunate for the disabled sod in a 60s' wheel chair holding on for dear life to the ambient noise of sexual wear n' tear.





// maybe speak about how the chemistry had somewhat died.

like tryin' ta squash Lego into squelched antelope. The world's smallest tongue, preaching a woman's biggest nightmare.

### At Bar

There's a particular mistress in every bar.

Clashed against the senses,

In a deafening reverberation of broken noise, the singing cheers and alcoholic folly of the bar left open a new a generation of patrons to falter and despair, clashing slovenly against the senses in an agonising huff of futility. It was clear who had become adjusted to the rein, those blacked out youth in their cordoroy t-shirts and labelled affair, justifying confidence with another stint at the bar. A drunken man swerves around me, smashing his head into the Irish trims lacing their way around the liquor tetrohedron of doom.

"Man, where do they find these women," I shout, knowing full-well that no one can hear me. I see Milo head to the bar, flirting with the waitress, before turning her head towards me with sharp smirk and a brief sneer in her eye, as if to suggest that I had some part to play

I always felt out of place at bars. Not that it felt artificial, but it's not the kind of place you would live in, so why would you want to hang out there?
