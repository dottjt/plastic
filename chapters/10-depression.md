"Moderately entertaining."

Tonight's obligations are being delivered pro rata, dragging itself miserably along the floor as a dead skunk spasms beside it, as it attempts to tell a joke about the inequality of nuts. Victorian times, oh dear. The scant face behind the ceiling snarls in grave fashion, hushing at the feint tapper of lovely's past. "Does the knife hurt, sweetie? Can you feel it grasp at your pain?"

I wasn't quite sure what to think of the haste pleasantries that were being thrown my way, lost in the thick quandary permeating through my velvet angular plea. Although in fashionable response I simply yawned at the thought and hovered away into the tight spaces pre-occupying the corridor into the cranked-up lounge awaiting my arrival.

"My compliments to the chef", I thought, rather aimlessly.

Sour grapes make a chaffy treat. The delicate spine hunches over it's desk without query, examining the shades of misconfigured lamp along the dark, cold walls supporting his fine trepidation into the literary foray. Sheets of paper describing mounds of ill-defined taste, blooming into a river of non-fluent diaspora. 

There's something disturbing, something brewing in his coffee, infecting his mind with an uncanny chatter - knocking over the wrinkles and follicles leeching from his face. It's apparent there's trouble, because the man is afraid. 

That man is me. 

And he doesn't even drink coffee, rendering the image weak.

I don't quite know what's going on right now, however I feel quaint.

I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull roundness.
"Don't fall off the train," they said. 

"It only comes once every two years, so unless if you're willing to choo, choo, choo - you better know your place, or be culled." 

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season for the Reade. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. 

Fuck you rabbit.
