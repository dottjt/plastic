It was any ordinary day. A sanctimonious tunnel-vision. 

A lone gunman was out scouting for some talent. Toothcomb pick. Leisure of hair. Several women frantically

The train was it's usual self. Flashing dreary over a bucket of cum someone had spilt over the padded lino


People glued to their phones.

The stock market had crashed.
