<!-- Walking into work. -->

It was any ordinary day. The sun continued it's glorious expansion, the trees basked in the overflowing radiation and children across the middle east strapped themselves to vests of high-impact explosives in faithful martyr of their magical prophet, while the U.S. remained ever-more ignorant of the internal politics of foreign occupation. "Fight a war, in a war," announces a young marshall kit in immaculate serviceman attire, as he paced the outskirts of a halal-certified brothel south of the Kuwait border. Crippled in fear and brooding anxiety, the NFL draft hopeful of 98' was plagued by the contrived fantasies of rape and lore he wished to impose upon these working-class women, driven by the bloody battle he fought against their now-dead husbands. With a gun in one hand and a thoughtless desire to seek pre-emptive revenge, the young man storms the building and pins down a screaming young woman, plunging his penis through her hijab and inside her petit figure. Blasting her brains out at the point of orgasm to complete the scene.

"That was quite overt," I thought to myself, as I took a moment to pause and think about the fundamental implications of my imagination, backdrop against the dyslexic array of dwellings littering the landscape of my train ride into work that particular morning. "...and as we enter our pods, secure in a tunnel-vision of pre-determined repetition, it's important that we remember to gloat at the shit-giggler. He is our only hope." I knew I should have stopped writing year's ago, my mind abuzz with all sorts of fantastical whims and jarring phrases, designed to fright and excite, like a pickled jar of boiled cantaloupe.

Dangled in a mop of disarray, my hair found itself in desperate need of attention. Part of me liked the slight emo gradle, constituent to my overall look as a crazed loner with a knack for competitive fighters and an infatuation for Japanese animated breasts. Oh, another day, another dawn. Rest our souls in the flashy marginalisation of peace, fervour and extreme exuberance. Then in a rush of temporal ammonia, I transferred my mind over to the hands of late-night regret, as I stepped off the train and onto the newly-renovated platform, into a compound of career psychopaths and keyboard warriors. Atop of a vending machine stood a lone gunman, armed with a toothpick and a bucket of cum, ready to drown solace in it's rightful place on the floor of an over-worked McDonalds where he got paid a meager salary and an inoffensive staff discount on all meals after 6pm.

Truth is that today was hardly ordinary.


People glued to their phones.

The stock market had crashed.

<!-- Walk down the promenade -->

There's something fantastic about sodomy. A religious travesty of heightened caution, no different to blowing up a entire school bus full of Indonesian school children, limbs akimbo, burnt sheets of trigonometry fluttering down in a cascade of ceremony, only to condemn those who practice formal expression in a much, much less formal way.

"You really are evil, aren't you?" says Milo, skipping about on the side walk, a-twirl in her own world of disturbing imagination of primary fascination. A curious beast I one-day hoped to tame and unleash, like a feel-good tsunami of sexual domination. Clearly, you didn't need to hear that.

"It's just a joke," I remarked, a light teaser of things to come, hoping to sound lost in my own intellectuality, obviously inundated in an air of desperation I'd simply accepted as the lonely cousin following me around everywhere.

The harbor atmosphere, caulked in the silhouette of a family galore, witnessing a domestic episode of "dad knows best", was suitably romantic, if not a touch endearing. As I looked up at the night sky, it was clear that the clouds were amiss in their treachery, shrouding their eerie ways into the whispering wind and creeping shadows, lurking and melding themselves into our fragmented movement refracting against the crayon river below. Thankfully it was just enough to convince her to hold my hand, something which I'd been thinking about since we first met.

I'd always been afraid of this moment, where man meets women, carried by the heavy hands of fate onto something greater. Where the expectation was loud and vast, ripping itself methodologically into the grain of your skin, scolding bone as a consequence of childish demeanor.

The interior of the large department mall barely knew itself.

The aromatic disparity grabs me and cuts into my wiring, and yet the beauty is undeniable.

"Did you always think we'd date?" she said, almost rhetorically, expecting me to cave in an


<!-- Talk about the fantasy of Milo. How he likes the idea of her, but isn't really into her. -->

<!-- At Bar -->

There's a particular mistress in every bar.

Clashed against the senses,


In a deafening reverberation of broken noise, the singing cheers and alcoholic folly of the bar left open a new a generation of patrons to falter and despair, clashing slovenly against the senses in an agonising huff of futility. It was clear who had become adjusted to the rein, those blacked out youth in their cordoroy t-shirts and labelled affair, justifying confidence with another stint at the bar. A drunken man swerves around me, smashing his head into the Irish trims lacing their way around the liquor tetrohedron of doom.


"Man, where do they find these women," I retort,



Admittedly, I was never much of an alcohol kind of guy. I always
