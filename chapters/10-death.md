## Scene 1 START

### Help Monologue

Hi. Have we met before? Probably not. It's nice to meet you. Yes, you. Oh, and I like your hair! I think it's really pretty. Seriously. You look gorgeous. Not quite Brad Pitt gorgeous, but it'll do. Sorry if that came across as sounding really cheesy. We're still cool, right? Cool. Oh, and thank you! That's really kind of you. I think you're cool too.

I suppose you're reading this message today because I need help. You see, I'm not okay. Which is weird when you think about, because what does that even mean? I mean, I'm still like living n' shit. But it just sucks. Everything. Just. Sucks. Everything is a thousand times harder than it should be, and that's just thinking about it. Fuck. I don't think I've even left left this room for the past two days. Why am I so fucked? Why can't I just be fucking normal? Would it be so hard just to unfuck myself for the next 10 minutes, so I can go grab a fucking packet of noodles and eat something. I put the pen down. It just wasn't working.

### Describe Morning

I didn't really feel much that morning. Nor did I have the desire to feel at all, let alone the energy to even understand what feelings were for. Unemployment was a drag. Rent I was at least four weeks overdue. You know, that thing which seemingly required constant attention, lest I disintegrate into a powder cheddar.



But at least I still had drugs. Drugs n' coffee. Coffee n' beans. I didn't like the beans so much, but the coffee made up for it.


But hey, it was a Saturday morning, the lungs were still breathing and I didn't quite have the courage to pull the trigger,  which essentially meant only one thing. It was time to tab.

### The Tab.

I couldn't remember when I first started taking tabs, but teenage me was always keen to try new things. Subtle ways to break the thin vein of tension which arose from thy evil, thy mother and thy sin. Tot n' trot. Thankfully adult me was even more than keen to spend his adult credits pursuing such desires, uncouth in the odities of human existence.

Take your ego for a spin through a

It was a bit like putting your brain through a lettuce spinner, it would help

Like most uncouth, tabs had become a regular fact of life. Ego refreshers. They helped break down absolutely everything you knew about yourself into useless piles of silt. Just fine enough that you couldn't quite hold it within your hands, but solid enough that you could see it with your own eyes. The key was to take em' once every two weeks, otherwise you'd end up messing with your tolerance. With something like LSD you could probably get away with takin' em' once every week, although LSD was nowhere near as strong as the research chemicals I was digesting. They were significantly cheaper, nearly 10 times as strong and they packed a punch which left you completely incapacitated in the most euphoric of ways. They were a variant of nBome. 25i-nBome. The strongest and most visual of the nBome compounds. Certainly if I had my own way, I'd be completely transfixed in a permanent state of constant morphing and transfixing. I loved the morphing. It was arguably the best feeling in the world, well-beyond the euphoria of porn. Porn while on tabs? I honestly couldn't possibly describe anything more euphoric in the whole entire world. I always described tabs as a kind of psychopathic candy land where you die and become god. An opportunity to explore how gullible you truly were.

Recently I've just been chaining them.

LSD was a Psychopath's playground.


The only thing I didn't like about the tabs was the vasoconstriction. It felt as if your veins were being suffocated from the outside-in.

The key with takin' tabs is to keep them away from light. It was also important to smoke weed beforehand, as it synergised with the psychadelic properties of hte tabs.

Thankfully the tabs were nothing like the seeds. You'd have to perform an alcohol extraction on them. I personally used methylated spirits, which more-or-less was pure ethanol, minus some compounds which were placed inside it to make you want to purge yourself. Some methylated spirits actually contain compounds which make you go blind. Thankfully I called the manufacturer and they confirmed that it was fully safe. They must have known that I was up to something.

### Describe The Wait

In. Out. In. Out.

Hoping to disperse its lovely little claws into your spread, violating what little aspiration you have to weed your way back to safety. At first it shrieks in a mad outburst, indicating its own displeasure with the world. Then it withers into a cloud of mould to suffocate any amount of apprehension from gaining necessary foothold. Lastly it smothers in absolute quantity, absorbing scar tissue and trauma at an incomprehensible rate. And once it's all over, in the snap of a heartbeat, it was as if nothing remained at all. A desolate fire of dementia, swept clean in an enticing devastation of brilliance.

### Hang out with a bad person.

I receive a text from an old acquaintance. Dealer. Badlands. Claims city. Fight club. The leech. Here at the bank of assistance, we truly value your customer service. Sign here, please. There was never an unopportune time for the leech to sink his insinuous teeth into your collarbone, holding on for dear life as you trash about in a manic frenzy. But he was company, and I needed company.

He rocks up in a stolen vehicle, licence plates removed from both rears. High on synthetic marijuana. Without a driver's licence to your name.


All I remember is the tesselation of the windows, as the fog rose from the dashboard.


### Waiting at town

I don't think I'd ever had synthetic weed before,

### Trickery - Bad Trip

Fading away.

I started kicking the car door down.
