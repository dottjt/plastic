## Scene 1 START

### Expressing love

An acoustic stream of pink decorations fluttered around me, gently letting me down ina a confetti of fairy dust. I couldn't have imagined anything more perfect than the sanctuary of her presence, held in esteem beyond the very words which brought her to life. More than anything, I simply wanted to hold her in my hand, pretending to be hers in every sense of the word. A lucky charm of eternity which

I could have stared at her for hours, absorbing the finer details of her skin. Hold her tight

The perfect image of cuckholdry

I could feel her body pressed against mine. The soft touch of her pores



So this is what love was. A pure evaporation if cynicism, .


. It was like staring at a godess.


She's distant.

### Waking up with Milo

Caught in a wisp of cold air, I was ecstatic.

The air was thin this morning. It had been quite cold recently, and I wasn't quite sure

"I think I have a condition."

"Fuck, you don't have syphilis, do you?", she spouted in an over-reaction of concern, hugging the bed-sheets in a last bastion of earthly safety.

"Oh no, it's not that.

"Try and talk about your mental il=ln

### Talk about making breakfast together.

"Wet cake makes for a soppy treat," she announces, floating her way to the heel of my toes, t-shirt draped across her bare shoulders.

### Breaking point.

### The breakup.

"I don't think I can do this anymore. I like you n' all, and I think you're a really smart and funny guy, but you're just not really my type."

My first reaction was to vomit. Either because I felt I deserved the pain of wretching my guts out, or because I felt so sick that I didn't know how else to respond.


 How does one feel rejection when they already live and breathe it by mere fracture of their existence?

"What do you mean? What more is there than being smart or funny?", I recited, following a long careful examination of the situation. Truth was, I was devastated.


### She leaves.

My first reaction once she'd left was to masturbate. It was remained in the sunken realisation that all hope had decided to evade me, leaving my corspe in a discoloured

It was what comforted me. Showed me peace. Helped soften the blow of having

### Cam girl

I loved cam girls. I mean, that's what they were there for. To be believed. To be loved. To provide some kind of

I would go as far as to write erotica for them.

I came into my hands, cusping the overflowing semen in the rim of my index finger. Then I reach for the tissue to clean up the mess. It was the same routine of glue and bleached tree wafer, scrumped into a ball and buried deep underground to be turned into fossilised shame. I always wondered if my addiction was a form of self-hate. A way to express how much I didn't like myself. I couldn't logically comprehend why I did it, but when your eyes are fixed on some blonde getting t-boned by two black men with a high school education, it turned you sour.
