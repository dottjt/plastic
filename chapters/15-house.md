<!-- Describe Fringe -->

All aboard the fringe. An effervescent display of gaudy rigour wrapped-fancy in a quarter-mile sweat-band of pound and flesh. Don't we all just love a set of fresh dazzling eyes, daudy fuckin' crand, carrying themselves helplessly towards the emotionless gaze of triumph tying us all together into this absolute pit of love and despair. My fingers dig-deep into the scar tissue oozing from my imagination, manic to the pixie queen shaking violently to an empty bottle of cultivar gin.

Recently I decided to buy a house, something which I would consider an achievement. Surely, anything which defines necessity should be considered an achievement, or has the necessity trumped me as part of some underground ritual of autonomous self-hate and misdemeanour. It has windows with a tight sheen for upper-class movement, and it's doors come fixed with an embrace for communal living. The backyard by any means, is a timid beast. It's what the vicar ordered and more.

And yet here we are. At a point suspended in time, despondent in it's awe, captured only moments ago on a 10' inch single-frame picture to be endlessly thrown into question, as the words drown you out approaching your 27th birthday. The cream-pie is delicious dear, please do make more.

"You know you look like shit, right," uttered my friend, casked in stack of boxes as he stumbled his way to the van.

"Go face-fuck yourself," I shouted, almost giddy at the uncompromising nature of my remark. It was always the delicate wordplay that astonished me, choking


 slightly choking on the wordplay for how smartly delicate it made me feel.



I live in the kind of area that demotes personality. It is new-found rugged, with a hearty family-core. The kind of place that instigates failure for white-men over the age of 50, as they prune their beards in hope of Anglican saviour. Don't like a kebab? Eat a kebab, you slut. This is the movement you wished for. Now go out and get it, you amiritious hunk of non-classification.

It won't quite eat you alive, but it's an easy thing to portray for those none-the-wiser. Eat the lies up sweetie. They're delicious in glee.


The first thing which hits you is the commute. It takes me roughly 2 hours to get to the city, which is something I've largely become accustomed to. For better or worse, necessity dictates all and with this newfound love you shall smile where those might weep and weep where the darkness continues. Pretty smile, pretty pickle. Don't be shy at this year's annual cluster-fuck drowning! Pray the body-bag fits your eyes, although there's an upgrade coming for next-season's killing.

I must admit, I actually had a bit of an outer-body experience when I looked at where exactly my residence was situated relative to the rest of the metropolis. It occurred to me that it was just as far away as my childhood home was, which at the time was in the complete sticks. Now I'm sure it's worth millions.

Certainly, I don't mind it. The whole this-is-your-new-life-not-so-different-to-the-old-one mentality. It's the kind of experience I wouldn't turn a blind-eye to, and as necessity itself states, a welcoming arduous cloverfield for all to compare. It is progress perched on a pedestal.

On the contrary, there is the life of unknowing privilege and I couldn't think of anything worse. It reminds me of all the rich, white folk on the train who throw a gut-wrenching tantrum about the train being 5 minutes late to their evening-gown souriee. Yes, I'm sure everything was great back in your day when Father Australia came round' n' force-fed Osmocote into the great gully of reserve you call Sunday's self-nourishment. And yes, we do hope to plunder your corpse with a pickaxe and a butter knife.

What I believe at the end of the day is in the power of resilience and so far, this seems to be the life I have planned. Change. Adaptation. Self-improvement. I mean, I no longer have any addictions. I have a career that means well. It's almost as if certainty and me have come to some sort of clandestine agreement never to argue again. Yet is something actually building up under the poorly-applied coat of paint dripping from my face? Is there a tension I've merely bottled up in replace for my seemingly irrational desires? Quite possibly, although ultimately like all human beings, I am simply trying my best.

Sure, there are times at night where I fall into an awful twitch. Usually in response to having so much responsibility around me, that I don't quite know how to cope. Although I suspect it's because of the huge-backlog of homeownership which taunts me in each frame of my existence. Is the avocado tree I planted going to suffer a heart-attack in the middle of the night? When will I have time to paint all these walls? And the who the fuck will build all this Ikea furniture?

All questions which will surely adapt and rearrange themselves in due time, as the pressure continues it's cataclysmic rise into some kind of post-orgasmic monster.

A young immigrant stares into my eyes, searing patiently with an immuninescent intensity set on forgotting his past. It's a psychological duel.
