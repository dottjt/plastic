## Scene 1 START

### Reproduction Introduction

A ten-ounce packet o' Hershey's sperm. That's all it takes to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big ol' sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the pseudoephedrine-encapsulated collaborations encrusting the outline of your mother's vagina. A relative cum dumpster of fire and pre-maritime froth. A permanent residence for father's facial cream. Cinematic in a netherworld of tartarus condemnation, erroding the hopes and dreams of those not yet born.

Pickle n' loam at the coquette mannequin obliging you to screech in hallowing pleasure, daffle at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in al fresco self-abuse, along with the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes have been generously funded by the Catholic Cum Laude and their pack of Irish henchmen. And for an almost inconspicuous price of college admission, a thirty-two-ounce bucket of ejaculate is all it takes to push n' pull through our beautiful fuck-thing, as our dashing pre-star announces herself in the presence of fifty-two young men, in a panoramic anxiety of imitation testosterone and knucklehead casualty. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea-inspired holes designed only to fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between Russian lit lectures.

### Describe suburbs

I always wondered if I'd have a piece of this one day, as I stared out of the train window and into the rolling hills of splendor. Surrounded by the lush green crust which upheld the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options, breathing dust into the brown insoluble clay brooding fortifying the monstrous structures which littered the landscape, built from Communist Party exuberance. Host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, taint to the mistress currently tying your illegible wife to a makeshift torture device as she fires holy incense into the deepest parts of her clitoris. These were the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by an incomplete set of Chinese housewives and their $5 cardigans made of refined polyester, stained with hints of Worcester sauce.

The artificial lakes. The sprawling villages. The orange provocative. Thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, quietly moan in the whispers of future generations, packed raving into a frantic frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

### Describe Rich Chinese

the 60s' architecture,

The 21st Century Asian is a fickle creature which did not need what it saw and only wanted what it had been told. A Hollywood bonanza of Western desires, trained inside an inferiority complex constructed since birth. In this ten-part series we will be demonstrating how you, an aspiring middle-aged Asian man, can also bring down the average. At the pyramid of the chain was the White Mercedes Benz, a status of council for lonely asian man in grey overalls. Spread legs wide around a plate of Hungrarian cheese, slopped around the mouth with a dollop of hoisin sauce.

### Approach the house

As I approached the rickety gate of the unkept two-storey weatherboard estate, I couldn't help but notice the surreal cheapness of what I was witnessing through the winter smog. Succulents and cacti of every kind, retrofit into an assortment of smashed clay pots and scratched non-stick pans, braced along the newly-concreted driveway held together by particles of dust and refined palm oil, perfectly serene in it's chemical absolution. I'd never seen a guava tree before, this great monstrous shrub which gorged upon the leaves of the tiny mandarin tree near the spralling gather of quaint sexual tension. Behind the house was the outline of the shed, an endless hoarders orgy of junk.

I quietly slipped in through the backdoor in hopes of avoiding her entirely, knowing deep-down inside that it was merely postponing the primitive courage required to deal with the barrage of not-quite-disappoint which was certain to come my way.

### Describe mother

Admittedly, I wasn't particularly keen to kick the dirt with my own mother. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap, slathered and smeared onto the mummified corpse of a freeze-dried tibetan whore, operational only in the sheer amount of high thread-count linen required to prevent the awful stench of yesterday's lingering bamboo cookware and fermented Tuscan crustaceans from melding with your senses. I doubt you even could have called her a mother, neither in a traditional sense nor in any type of convoluted metaphor. I never loved her. I never understood her. I never really felt anything for her, with exception to the seeping animosity which bloomed like a pond of algae, suffocating all life below. She was nothing more than a sully pair of hands, pushing and shoving me towards the human equivalent of an emotional meat-mincer. Forget the hugs and the punishing positivity, and lay welcome to our new forefathers of back-handed compliments and soul-piercing judgements. A faulty groundwork of stifling insecurity and suicidal thoughts, elegantly packaged to assist you in creatively discovering new ways to feel helpless and sad about yourself, later to be confused with the primordial lust you conjure at even the slightest sight of affection. Put simply, she was never around.

### Describe comparison

A comparison board of curdled chutney to be diced, she was a woman who loved to compare. It was in her blood. It was what coursed through her arteries in an ephemeral caustic stew of joy. I was never good enough by design. My intellect. My genetics. My innate ability to feel. All notable concerns on the creaky prize-wheel of informal assessment, disposed in decree of supple factuality. Caught in a loop of incomprehension, she would constantly measure my height, customising my self-esteem to her privy attention, iterating me that I would better fit her image if only I were just a litte bit taller. What resulted was an inescapable pocket of hardened emotion, tumbling and forming under a tipsy dissonance of humiliating refactor, reconfiguring itself at even the slightest contact of oxygen. Drowning in expectation, trapped inside her matrix of unrealistic standards. By the end of the cycle, you never quite knew how to feel about it. The beat-down was real and the relegation was taut.

Thankfully, she was getting old. Her greying hairs now dominating her futile attempts to stamp them out with black ink, she was too weak to control the world around her, yet completely comfortable in her incessant complaints of the world, as if the vitality of expression were an improvement within itself.

## Scene 2 START


### Mother Greeting

"You're late," responds a small upright figure, face like a porcelain horse. Spatula in hand, ready to strike at any moment. Her helper sits beside her, acute in the Stockholm complex wrapping his hooligan brain in an enticing fantasy land of denial. Neither lover, nor friend, I never quite understood the relationship the helper wore. Although he was older, married and unsuitably kind in his rhetoric, he yet preferred to spend his time in the company of cretin scum. Building. Sowing. Tending to his leash on a mortified penance of penalty and punishment. Only my mother was capable of deceiving the very basis of human evolution, raw in a pursuit of self-preservation which tore at the old white men of societies past. Especially when they were carrying her shopping.

"Why you not come see me anymore? I waste my life feeding you, and this is how you treat me?"

"I fucking hate you," I responded. Actually, that's not quite what I said, but it's precisely what my mouth wanted to say. Perhaps it was a cry from a different dimension. A prophecy fulfilled. I'd cunt punt her and knock her out with a bar of silver, if only I could find a way to mask the awful stench of old white dick emanating from her pussy. I suppose that really summarised our relationship. A mechanical exchange of contracts and titles, sacred in the punishment which disguised itself as a motherly love. Another sad case of right time, wrong hole. I'm sure my birth certificant wasn't too inaccurate in that respect.

### Describe porn usage

You see, kids like me didn't have mothers. We had computer screens. Static interactions full of colourful smut and pornographic titilation. Playful fun-things for our deluded femininity to simulate with thousands of other neglected children, as a gentle introduction to the world of shadows. A kind of twisted fundamental truth that would allow you to twirl your ego for hours on end, as you attempt to dangle a mammoth-sized strap-on around your knee in order to satisfy your quench for cradled inclusion. On the internet there were no barriers. You didn't have to shake some shady cum-ridden hand within a confined petrol station restroom, just to witness your first set of silicone breasts. You did't even have to leave your own room, let alone the own auspices of your bed-ridden shame. The screen was just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into the fantastic lust-filled imagination of sex and gore, tweaking your most fundamental ambitions into an inclination for flickering pixels. A young child sits in a room alone, awaiting cross-legged for his favourite cam girl to smile, if only to feel the warm embrace of a hug, held by his hands frantically masturbating the glowing rash developing from within his shaft. Welcome our new defacto parents of the world. An opportunity to rid the stain from your genes and introduce yourself to a new life of agrarian pleasure.

I remember participating in my first gang-bang at 12. There I was. Sitting in my chair. Brain enveloped in something magical. At first it was truly mesmerising, like placing your hand into a soulless lucky dip to find some authentic caricature of a set of laced panties. Eyes darting around the screen in a morbid photographic fixation with the imposing image of breast and triggering keywords. Fuck. Whore. XXX. The vocabulary was your play-pen. A visual casino without walls, glittering in the cerulean madness restraining you suspenseful initiation. A small girl thigh-high tights flashes her vagina in an inconsequential display of voyeurism. It is class. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of vaseline warfare, keeping your brain intact and out of stunted order. A need. A dire situation of requirement. A lethargic reminder of your own existence, as you enclave your existence within an overwhelming bombardment of obscene destitution. Then begins the rape. The Lithuanian gang bangs. The brutality of forced-torture and poly-amorous anthropomorphism, shoved into the sweaty paws of a furry suit fit for enough disenfranchised cocks to choke a small horse to death. Orphaned children dying in a fledgling fuck-storm of medical disaster, fists shoved so deep into so many tight spaces that not even the coroner can keep up.

### Eat lunch with my mother

The vintage dining table reached out towards a broken family of none. The helper sat with his ankles tied in a handcuff knot of submissive apprehension, agitated in the scars he picked from his face in an imperfect spiral of manic paranoia. His long fingers tenderly clutching a pair of chopsticks which bore the word 'slave' in traditional Chinese. I didn't know what to say to him, other than to shrewdly poke my eyes at the way he would sneak ounces of snuff into his gums, as he began to yearn in a smitten barm of deranged twitching. The confidence in his eyes, hemorrhaging draino by the trench full. Besides the table was a mosaic of childhood pictures and , stepelled

"Why you not help bring food to table?"

"Alright, calm down."

"Don't tell me to calm down! I am your mother! Now you go get food!"

Carrying back a bowl of rice and a mixed variety of dried fish and roasted porcupine, I sat for a second time next to the helper, now passed out in a nicotine mist of hoarfrost. The pickled cabbage and muzzy black bean cauliflower were ladden with enough dehydrated corn flour to kill a small horse. The rice entered my mouth, as I sat there in a spire of modern arcadia, mind prefixed on grabbing mother's face and shredding it along the outside brick wall. Usually we didn't speak. The only time she would speak was to tell me off or criticise me for not being more like her. A decrepit pit of satanic translucence and hardened cum.

### Father

I didn't know a lot about my father. He was more of a blur, than a curiosity. Admittedly it never really bothered me a great deal. It's hard to complain about something that's not there, that you don't have a mental reference to compare against. No one to blame. No one to praise.

"You need to find a partner," she blurts, fish-bone stuck between her two front teeth.

"I don't know." That was how I usually responded to her antics.

// What is the climax which reaches this point? I don't know yet.

Most of what she said usually drowned itself out into an inconsequential wave of white noise, streaming itself as quickly out of my mind as possible.

There was always a sense of hope that one day she would change. That she would one day wake with a kind of clarity that would completely flush he brain out and allow her to truly understand who she was. Instead, her mind seem liked a hotpot of sharpnel, forever reacting with



For a split second, I had an epiphany. There I was, suspended in time. I could see myself in plain view. I realised that I didn't have to put up with this. That I physically could remove myself from this situation.



I couldn't take it anymore. I was going to do it. My gosh, I was actually going to do it. I couldn't quite believe it, but it was finally going to happen. Ecstatic with a burst of infinite possibility, I stood up from my chair, told my mother to fuck herself, and left the room. It felt as if I'd transformed into a butterfly. I felt enummerably lighter than I did before. Calmer. More in control. At this point, I really didn't care about . For the first time in my entire life, I felt in-control.


"That's it. I've had enough get fucked."

"WHAT!?"

She grabbed .

"That's right, you fucking bitch. Go fuck yourself.


### Mother turns

Something had changed in her. The moment had arrived. In an incredulous panic of resounding fear, she runs for me. But I am not there. Her prize had disappeared from her grasp. From her far-reaching judgement.

## Scene 3 START

### Describe Suburbs

Purple houses. Red parlours. Caracature crackers with an assortment of porous scars, silly with their dilly in this well sought-after town. The voice of a frail American approaches a caustic Chinese housewife, strapped with a yoga mat and a bottle of plum sauce lubricant, re-used from next door's shoot. Several cars arrive at the mansion. A camera crew and a giant dildo in the shape of a plastic dragon. The Shenzhen steel conglomeration were in for a real treat this year. Wild game, they called it. A royal competition where the wives of Communist Party leaders were wrapped inside a thick blanket of dyed red-ink, fucked with a Communist Party sponsored dildo and those that survived the 8-foot long dragon would be crowned winner, the ornament permanently lodged inside their vagina. The civility was bare, although I doubt they could have ever imagined it any other way. The pacing was off, for sure.

### Train Ride Back

Although I could feel myself gasping at the recklessness of my actions, there was also something quite magical about the calm tingle of the rush that had persisted till now. Like a giant dove carrying me in a wet drove of uncertainty, as the country-bound train forced itself along the motionless barren tracks, facilitating my desire to simply shut down and remove myself from the world. Was I bad person? Did I inflict harm onto others? Do I even have a choice. It felt as if I was part of some kind of definitive cycle of abusive psychopaths and manipulative low-lives, born out of a never-ending chain of bad parenting and alcohol abuse. I guess everyone wants to be 'the one' who breaks the cycle, but whether that were even humanely possible, I couldn't say for sure.

I closed my laptop and broke down in a tidal wave of tears and emotion. Maybe the lady sitting in front of me would even find the sensitivity attractive, before propositioning to hold me and later provide me with a cheeky hand-job in the latter part of the carriage. And if only I weren't such a good liar. It was just me alone in this brightly-lit space. Trapped with all the time in the world to think less of my uncontrollable actions.
