### Reproduction Introduction

A ten-ounce packet o' Hershey's sperm. That's all it takes to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big ol' sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the pseudoephedrine-encapsulated collaborations encrusting the outline of your mother's vagina. A relative cum dumpster of fire and pre-maritime froth; father's permanent residence of industrial strength facial cream. Cinematic in a netherworld of tartarus condemnation, erroding the hopes and dreams of our children not yet born.

Pickle n' loam at the coquette mannequin obliging you to screech in hallowing pleasure, daffle at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in al fresco self-abuse, along with the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes have been generously funded by the Catholic Cum Laude and their pack of Irish henchmen. And for an almost inconspicuous price of college admission, a thirty-two-ounce bucket of ejaculate is all it takes to push n' pull through our beautiful fuck-thing, as our dashing pre-star announces herself in the presence of a cascade of young men. Pumped full of imitation testosterone in a panoramic anxiety of knucklehead casualty. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea-inspired holes designed only to fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between Russian lit lectures.

### Describe suburbs

I always wondered if I'd have a piece of this one day, as I stared out of the train window and into the rolling hills of splendor. The lush green crust which upheld the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options, breathing dust into the brown insoluble clay of the first people's home. Monstrous 60s' Brutalism. Communist Party Exuberance. These were the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by an incomplete set of Chinese housewives and their $5 cardigans made of refined polyester, stained with hints of Worcester sauce. They were pure amalgamations of smog and flesh for the lungs to gorge, and the heart to deny. The artificial lakes. The sprawling villages. The orange provocative. Host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, moan in quiet whispers for future generations to beware. Their tiny arms and legs packed ravage in a frantic frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, has his cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the Chinese upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

### Describe Rich Chinese

The 21st Century Asian was a fickle creature which did not need what it saw, and only wanted what it was told. A Hollywood bonanza! of Western desires, labored inside a steel-reinforced inferiority complex constructed since birth. A base-model Mercedes Benz masked by the smell of a daughter's fetus, baked in the backseat on a hot summer's day. A council of status for the grey Asian men stalking the streets with a lead pipe and a desire for hard liquor. Wifebeater on. Military haircut engaged. Cigarette in ear. Toothpick in hand. Teeth in gangrene. Legs spread wide around a plate of Hungrarian cheese, slopped around the mouth with a dollop of hoisin sauce. A walking, high-rise anatomy of plastic duty, paid in sex and cheap dinner meals. Just like mother ordered when Chengkai Shek and his gang, kicked down her front doors and raped her in a yellow collective. Oh, how me so sorry.

### Approach the house

As I approached the rickety gate of the unkept weatherboard estate, I couldn't help but notice the surreal elongation of it all. The eroded panels of elasticised walnut, flourishing in a chemical absolution of sanctified degrade. Consent to wither and perish. Thistles the size of cabins, entrenching their positions along the brick parchment and bringing kingdom to the rodents whom invented war and religion. Succulents and cacti of every kind, retrofit into an assortment of smashed pots and non-stick pans, braced along a poorly-paved driveway held together by particles of cinder and refined palm oil. The quell horror of the tantamount ground soak, schisming beneath me in a seizure of tumble and decay. Raring to swallow me into it's posture of resolute forgiveness. The front facade of the house truly was a postmodern construction site for the aggrieved. A sick sympathy of existence, praying at the border for a distinct ethos to arrive and wash it all away. I quietly made my fetter along the house, slipping in through the backdoor in the hopes of being avoided, knowing deep-down inside that I was merely postponing the primitive courage required to deal with the barrage of not-quite disappoint which was certain to come my way. This was the house of my mother.

### Describe mother

Admittedly, I wasn't particularly keen to kick the dirt with my mother. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap, slathered and smeared onto the mummified corpse of a freeze-dried tibetan whore. Operational only in the sheer amount of high thread-count linen required to prevent the awful stench of yesterday's lingering bamboo cookware and fermented Tuscan crustaceans from melding with your soul. I doubt you even could have called her a mother, either in a traditional sense, nor in convoluted metaphor. I never loved her. I never understood her. I never really felt anything for her, with exception to the seeping animosity which bloomed like a pond of algae, suffocating all life below. She was nothing more than a sully pair of hands, pushing and shoving me towards the human equivalent of an emotional meat-grinder. Forget the hugs and the encouraging positivity, and lay welcome to our new forefathers, the King of back-handed compliments and the Queen of soul-piercing atrophy. A faulty groundwork of stifling insecurity and suicidal thoughts, elegantly packed into a used condom to assist you in creatively discovering new ways to feel helpless and contrived, later to be confused with the primordial lust you conjure at even the slightest sight of affection. Your brain and me, voted most likely to part ways and never speak again. Put simply, she was never around to care.

### Describe comparison

She was a woman who loved to compare. An advisory board of curdled chutney, to be diced and sauteed into a creme brulee of pickling torment. It was in her blood to persecute, dement and imprison. To embrace the thin strands of judgement coursing through her arteries in an ephemeral stew of caustic joy. I was never good enough by design. My intellect. My genetics. My innate ability to feel. All notable concerns on the creaky prize-wheel of informal assessment, carefully decomposed in a decree of supple factuality. Caught in an unending loop of fatal incomprehension. It was her duty to insistently measure and customise my self-esteem to her privy attention, iterating my existence so that I could better fit her ideal image of a son, if only so I could just be that litte bit more unobtainably taller. The awe and beauty of a broken leaf, crisp in a vat of blistering expectation, trapped inside her matrix of unrealistic criterion. Holding on, only by the synapses taunting you awake.

Thankfully, she was getting old. A former shell of the wrath which she bore within. Her greying hairs, now dominating her unremitting attempts to remain relevant. Eyes like an aging tiger. Too weak to control the world around her, yet so completely comfortable in the conviction she wore with pride. A cunt with a duck for a face.

## Scene 2 START

### Mother Greeting

"You're late!", larks a small upright figure, face like a porcelain horse. Spatula in hand. Ready to strike at the given.

"I fucking hate you," I respond in an immediate thrash of anger. Actually, that wasn't quite what I said. It was more a moment of silence, if anything. An acknowledgement of the situation in civil terms, even though I could feel the outline of those words seep from my mouth, in a desperate attempt for oxidation, prophecised to enact justice on thy foe. An impalpable excuse to knock her out with my bare hands, and throw her stunned corpse into a wood chippery disguised as a retirement home. Chirpity. Chirp. Chip. If only I could find a way to mask the awful stench of pre-historic white dick emanating from her pussy. That unbearable cauliflower smear which housed semen from the late 1940s'. Then and only then might I have worked up the courage to approach her in vain.

And without remise, kneeling in faithful gratitude at the helm, was her helper. A frail Estonian man. Mr. Stockholm. The lord of preach and denial. Older, married and unsuitably kind. Neither lover, nor friend. Neither quaint, nor pretend. A farce. Amend. I never quite understood the relationship that the helper wore, only that he was one and she was infinity. The kind of doe-daddy calculation that would make even the most abstract mathematicians want to cry. An adoration of cretin scum. Building. Sowing. Fortifying his leash on a mortified penance of penalty and punishment. A deception of human evolution. A carrier of shopping bags. Fall.

"Why don't you come to see me anymore? I'm your mother, you should treat me better." I suppose that summarised our relationship. A mechanical exchange of contracts and titles, quantified by your ability to cease and desist. An offer in one hand. Your life in the next. A sacred punishment which regressed itself as a motherly love, without the love, nor the necessity. Another sad case of right time, wrong hole. Dull me, honey.

### Describe porn usage

Then in a sudden whirlwind of anchored correspondence, it became unreasonably clear to me that the woman standing in front of my very eyes was nothing more than a ruse. A pseudo-salad concoction of infallible consumption, shoved so far down my throat that I could barely even taste the difference between my own plain and pleasure. It had become apparent in my eyes that my true mother was in fact the one thing which I'd spent most my life abhorring. The gentle brothel of care which had kept me engaged with my own life, far more pronounced than she ever did. My computer screen. A place for meals to be relished without the incessant precaution of judgement, where my feelings of inadequacy could be washed away in a pixel haze of hyperphallic euphoria. Stretched like a taut violin. Laced and chewed with paranoia. In a wholeful neglect of deluded femininity. A static interaction of colourful smut. Click. Click. Crunch. Curated communities of mutilated chests and cosplay vaginas, dangled as a wholesome cure for the crippling anxiety you construct by the mouthful. The totality of your vision wanes into an attrition of befuddled harmony, as you attempt to surmount a mammoth-sized strap-on onto your child-sized knee. Satisfying your quench for cradled inclusion, diluted in a fire of self-hate and glorification. Waxing in glee, correctively at ease.

The screen was a world away from the ancient cum-ridden rituals of blowing some fat-fuck inside the confines of a gas station restroom, just to witness your first set of silicone breasts on the centre-fold of some greasy Playboy magazine. Hell, you didn't even have to leave your own bedroom, let alone the auspices of your own shame. The screen was just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into a fantastic lust-filled self-proclamation of sex and whore, tweaking your most fundamental ambitions into an indecent inclination for cinematic nudity and makeshift affection. A young child sits cross-legged in a room alone, awaiting the online presence of his favourite cam girl. Sad. Moan. If only to feel the warm embrace of her smile, as he masturbates frantically in a glowing rash of pampered silence. And thus, we welcome our new defacto parents to the world. A semi-pregnant teenager with a face-tattoo for a passport. A glamourous opportunity to rid the stain from our genes and introduce ourselves to a new life of agrarian pleasure. My brain enveloped in something magical. The pinch of my sticky fingers clamoured together in a witness of unholy relegation. Burnt like bleached popsicles. Covered in the pornographic titillation I ravaged in isolation, as my mother gargled white dick in the bedroom over. Who'd knew you could develop an OCD for sucking cock. Perhaps I would be next.

So there I was. Sitting at my desk. Participating in my first gang-bang at the age of 12. At first it was mesmerising. A virtual casino of visual brilliance. A radical lucky-dip of laced panties and ripped bras. The way it teases and captures, glittering in the cerulean madness restraining you craving for quantum initiation. A small girl in thigh-high tights flashes her vagina in an inconsequential display of voyeurism. It is class. You are class. Your eyes, captured in lore, dart around the screen in a morbid fixation with the keywords triggering you into an untimely calamity of horrific resplendence. Fuck. Whore. Death. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of vaseline warfare, keeping your brain intact and in a stunted phase of disrepair. A need. A requirement. A lethargic reminder of your own existence, as you enclave your mind in an overwhelming bombardment of obscene destitution. Then begins the rape. The Lithuanian gang bangs. The brutality of forced-torture and poly-amorous anthropomorphism, shoved into the sweaty paws of a furry suit fit for enough disenfranchised cocks to choke a small horse to death. Orphaned children dying in a fledgling fuck-storm of medical disaster, fists shoved so deep into so many tight spaces that not even the coroner can keep up. This was life, and life was me. Duty to my disaster.

### Eat lunch with my mother

The vintage dining table reached out towards a broken family of none. The helper sat with his ankles tied in a handcuff knot of submissive apprehension, agitated in the scars he picked from his face in an imperfect spiral of manic paranoia. His long fingers tenderly clutching a pair of chopsticks which bore the word 'slave' in traditional Chinese. I didn't know what to say to him, other than to shrewdly poke my eyes at the way he would sneak ounces of snuff into his gums, as he began to yearn in a smitten barm of deranged twitching. The confidence in his eyes, hemorrhaging draino by the trench full. Besides the table was a mosaic of childhood pictures and , stepelled

"Why you not help bring food to table?"

"Alright, calm down."

"Don't tell me to calm down! I am your mother! Now you go get food!"

Carrying back a bowl of rice and a mixed variety of dried fish and roasted porcupine, I sat for a second time next to the helper, now passed out in a nicotine mist of hoarfrost. The pickled cabbage and muzzy black bean cauliflower were ladden with enough dehydrated corn flour to kill a small horse. The rice entered my mouth, as I sat there in a spire of modern arcadia, mind prefixed on grabbing mother's face and shredding it along the outside brick wall. Usually we didn't speak. The only time she would speak was to tell me off or criticise me for not being more like her. A decrepit pit of satanic translucence and hardened cum.

### Father

I didn't know a lot about my father. He was more of a blur, than a curiosity. Admittedly it never really bothered me a great deal. It's hard to complain about something that's not there, that you don't have a mental reference to compare against. No one to blame. No one to praise.

"You need to find a partner," she blurts, fish-bone stuck between her two front teeth.

"I don't know." That was how I usually responded to her antics.

// What is the climax which reaches this point? I don't know yet.

Most of what she said usually drowned itself out into an inconsequential wave of white noise, streaming itself as quickly out of my mind as possible.

There was always a sense of hope that one day she would change. That she would one day wake with a kind of clarity that would completely flush he brain out and allow her to truly understand who she was. Instead, her mind seem liked a hotpot of sharpnel, forever reacting with



For a split second, I had an epiphany. There I was, suspended in time. I could see myself in plain view. I realised that I didn't have to put up with this. That I physically could remove myself from this situation.

What resulted was an inescapable pocket of hardened emotion, tumbling and forming under a tipsy dissonance of humiliating refactor, reconfiguring itself at even the slightest contact of oxygen. The beat-down was real and the relegation was fraught.


I couldn't take it anymore. I was going to do it. My gosh, I was actually going to do it. I couldn't quite believe it, but it was finally going to happen. Ecstatic with a burst of infinite possibility, I stood up from my chair, told my mother to fuck herself, and left the room. It felt as if I'd transformed into a butterfly. I felt enummerably lighter than I did before. Calmer. More in control. At this point, I really didn't care about . For the first time in my entire life, I felt in-control.


"That's it. I've had enough get fucked."

"WHAT!?"

She grabbed .

"That's right, you fucking bitch. Go fuck yourself.


### Mother turns

Something had changed in her. The moment had arrived. In an incredulous panic of resounding fear, she runs for me. But I am not there. Her prize had disappeared from her grasp. From her far-reaching judgement.

## Scene 3 START

### Describe Suburbs

Purple houses. Red parlours. Caracature crackers with an assortment of porous scars, silly with their dilly in this well sought-after town. The voice of a frail American approaches a caustic Chinese housewife, strapped with a yoga mat and a bottle of plum sauce lubricant, re-used from next door's shoot. Several cars arrive at the mansion. A camera crew and a giant dildo in the shape of a plastic dragon. The Shenzhen steel conglomeration were in for a real treat this year. Wild game, they called it. A royal competition where the wives of Communist Party leaders were wrapped inside a thick blanket of dyed red-ink, fucked with a Communist Party sponsored dildo and those that survived the 8-foot long dragon would be crowned winner, the ornament permanently lodged inside their vagina. The civility was bare, although I doubt they could have ever imagined it any other way. The pacing was off, for sure.

### Train Ride Back

Although I could feel myself gasping at the recklessness of my actions, there was also something quite magical about the calm tingle of the rush that had persisted till now. Like a giant dove carrying me in a wet drove of uncertainty, as the country-bound train forced itself along the motionless barren tracks, facilitating my desire to simply shut down and remove myself from the world. Was I bad person? Did I inflict harm onto others? Do I even have a choice. It felt as if I was part of some kind of definitive cycle of abusive psychopaths and manipulative low-lives, born out of a never-ending chain of bad parenting and alcohol abuse. I guess everyone wants to be 'the one' who breaks the cycle, but whether that were even humanely possible, I couldn't say for sure.

I closed my laptop and broke down in a tidal wave of tears and emotion. Maybe the lady sitting in front of me would even find the sensitivity attractive, before propositioning to hold me and later provide me with a cheeky hand-job in the latter part of the carriage. And if only I weren't such a good liar. It was just me alone in this brightly-lit space. Trapped with all the time in the world to think less of my uncontrollable actions.
