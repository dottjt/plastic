<!-- Describe reproduction -->

A ten-ounce packet o' Hershey's sperm is all it takes a to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big ol' sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the pseudoephedrine-encapsulated collaborations encrusting the outline of your mother's vagina. A relative cum dumpster of fire and frothy regret. Crunch n' sizzle bitches, groan in the delirious mannequin coquette causing you to screech in hallowing pleasure, daffle at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in post-war self-abuse and the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes and valid have been generously funded by the Catholic Cum Laude and their pack of Irish henchmen. And for the almost inconspicuous price of college admission, it only takes an entire hoard of sperm to push n' pull through our beautiful fuck-thing, as our dashing pre-star surrounds herself in the presence of anxious young men, pumped full of imitation testosterone and a natural tendency for the knucklehead life. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea-inspired holes designed only to generously fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between Russian lit lectures.

<!-- Describe suburbs -->

I always wondered if I'd have a piece of this one day, as I stared out of the scratched-out glaze of the train windows ahead and into the rolling hills of splendor, surrounded by the lush green crust which upholds the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options breathing life into the thick insoluble clay leeching into the 60s' architecture which hadn't quite bucked the trend. These are the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by an incomplete set of Chinese housewives and their $5 cardigans made of refined polyester and hints of Worcester sauce. Monstrous structures built from Communist Party exuberance, host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, taint to the mistress currently tying your illegible wife to a makeshift torture device as she fires holy incense into the deepest parts of her clitoris. The artificial lakes and sprawling villages, thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, quietly moan in the whispers of future generations, packed raving into a frantic frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

<!-- Describe mother -->

Admittedly, I wasn't particularly keen to kick the dirt with my own mother. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap,  slathered and smeared onto the mummified corpse of a freeze-dried tibetan whore, operational only in the sheer amount of high thread-count linen required to prevent the awful stench of yesterday's lingering bamboo cookware and fermented Tuscan crustaceans from melding with your senses. I doubt you even could have called her a mother, neither in a traditional sense nor in any type of convoluted metaphor. I never loved her. I never felt anything for her, with exception to the seeping animosity which bloomed like a pond of algae, suffocating all life below. She was nothing more than a sully pair of hands, pushing and shoving me towards the human equivalent of an emotional meat-mincer. Forget the hugs and the punishing positivity, and lay welcome to our new forefathers of back-handed compliments and soul-piercing judgements. A faulty groundwork of stifling insecurity and suicidal thoughts, elegantly packaged to assist you in creatively discovering new ways to feel helpless and sad about yourself, later to be confused with the primordial lust you conjure at even the slightest sight of affection. I remember she would constantly compare me. In particular, she would consistently measure my height, telling me that I would just be a bit better if only I

Thankfully, she was getting old. Her greying hairs now dominating her futile attempts to stamp them out with black ink, she was too weak to control the world around her, yet completely comfortable in her incessant complaints of the world, as if the vitality of expression were an improvement within itself.

<!-- Describe porn -->

You see, kids like me didn't have mothers. We had pornstars, playful fun-things of deluded femininity and simulated courage. A kind of  fundamental truth that would allow you to twirl for hours on end, as you attempt to dangle a mammoth-sized strap-on around your knee in order to satisfy your quench for inclusion. There are no barriers. No shady cum-ridden hand to shake in a confined petrol station restroom, just to witness your first set of fake breasts. You don't even have to leave your room, let alone the shadows of your own past. It's just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into the fantastic lust-filled imagination of, providing you with your most fundamental desire to seek clarity in a world so lost with purpose. A young child sits in a room alone, awaiting cross-legged for his favourite cam girl to smile, if only to feel the warm embrace of a hug, held by his hands frantically masturbating the glowing rash developing from within his shaft. Welcome our new defacto parents of the world. An opportunity to rid the stain from your genes and introduce yourself to a new life of agrarian pleasure. I remember participating in my first gang-bang at 12. There I was. Sitting in my chair. Brain enveloped in something magical. At first it was truly mesmerising, like placing your hand into a soulless lucky dip to find some authentic caricature of a set of laced panties. Eyes darting around the screen in a morbid photographic fixation with the imposing image of breast and triggering keywords. Fuck. Whore. XXX. The vocabulary was your play-pen. A visual casino without walls, glittering in the cerulean madness restraining you suspenseful initiation. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of constant warfare, keeping your brain intact and out of inconsequential order. A need. A dire situation of requirement. A lethargic reminder of your own existence, as you enclave your existence within an overwhelming bombardment of smut and obscene destitution. Then begins the rape. The Lithuanian gang bangs. The brutality of forced-torture and poly-amorous anthropomorphism, shoved into the sweaty paws of a furry suit fit for enough disenfranchised cocks to choke a small horse to death. Orphaned children dying in a fledgling fuck-storm of medical disaster, fists shoved so deep into so many tight spaces that not even the coroner can keep up. Anaphylactically gaping in a heaping mess of cum, tepid in the shame piling from my shaft, I cautious put away the image of my ex, frustrated in the coy optimism I promised myself hours ago never to revisit those memories again. I wasn't quite sure what kind of a future I had without my failure to function as a human being, but it managed to hold me down and actively dilute me at every possible chance. It was hard to even identify who I really was. I was uncouth.

<!-- Describe interaction with mother, as well as house -->

Succulents and cacti of every kind, retrofit into all sorts of clay pots n' pans, braced along the newly-concreted driveway,  which had been installed out of religious purity. It's finer connections held together by particles of dust and refined palm oil, perfectly serene in it's chemical absolution. I quietly slipped in through the backdoor in hopes of avoiding her entirely, knowing deep-down inside that it was merely postponing the primitive courage required to deal with the barrage of not-quite-disappoint which was certain to come my way.

"You're late," responds a small upright figure, face like a porcelain horse. Spatula in hand, ready to strike at any moment. Her helper sits besides her, acute in the Stockholm complex wrapping his hooligan brain in an enticing fantasy land of denial. Neither lover, nor friend, I never quite understood the relationship the helper wore. Although he was older, married and unsuitably kind in his rhetoric, he yet preferred to spend his time in the company of cretin scum. Building. Sowing. Tending to his leash on a mortified penance of penalty and punishment. Only my mother was capable of deceiving the very basis of human evolution, raw in a pursuit of self-preservation which tore at the old white men of societies past. Especially when they were carrying her shopping.

"Why don't you ever come to see me anymore?"

"I fucking hate you," I responded.

The thing I struggled with most was the expectation I felt from her presence. I didn't quite know how to feel.

On the vintage dining table in front of us which uncomfortably sat a broken family of none,

She popped down a bowl of rice, mixed with a variety of dried-fish

dishes ladden with




It's probably why I refuse to have sex with an asian woman. It would be too much like fucking my own mother.


<!-- Talk about guilt -->

As I sat there in a spire of modern arcadia, mind prefixed on grabbing mother's face and shredding it along the outside brick wall.

Talk about the guilt you feel as a son.


<!-- Father -->

I can't say I know a lot about my father.


<!-- In the bathroom -->
I'm sure the snail cream


"You need to find a partner," she says.

Most of what she said usually drowned itself out into an inconsequential wave of white noise, streaming itself as quickly out of my mind as possible.




<!-- I end up breaking up, never seeing her again -->

I couldn't take it anymore. I was going to do it. My gosh, I was actually going to do it. I couldn't quite believe it, but it was finally going to happen. Ecstatic with a burst of infinite possibility, I stood up from my chair, told my mother to fuck herself, and left the room. It felt as if I'd transformed into a butterfly. I felt enummerably lighter than I did before. Calmer. More in control. At this point, I really didn't care about . For the first time in my entire life, I felt in-control. 

You could tell something had changed in her.

"

 burst from my chair, slamming my cup down

"I'm breaking up,"

"What do you mean you're breaking up?


Hopefully I would never have to see her again.
