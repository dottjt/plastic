<!-- A chapter about reproduction, the Chinese suburbs, my mother and my porn addiction. We argue and I cut her off. -->

<!-- Reproduction Introduction -->

A ten-ounce packet o' Hershey's sperm is all it takes a to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big ol' sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the pseudoephedrine-encapsulated collaborations encrusting the outline of your mother's vagina, a relative cum dumpster of fire and frothy regret. Crunch n' sizzle bitches, groan in the delirious mannequin coquette causing you to screech in hallowing pleasure, daffle at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in al fresco self-abuse and the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes and valid have been generously funded by the Catholic Cum Laude and their pack of Irish henchmen. And for the almost inconspicuous price of college admission, it only takes an entire hoard of sperm to push n' pull through our beautiful fuck-thing, as our dashing pre-star surrounds herself in the presence of anxious young men, pumped full of imitation testosterone and a natural tendency for the knucklehead life. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea-inspired holes designed only to generously fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between Russian lit lectures.

<!-- Describe suburbs -->

I always wondered if I'd have a piece of this one day, as I stared out of the scratched-out glaze of the train windows ahead and into the rolling hills of splendor, surrounded by the lush green crust which upholds the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options breathing life into the thick insoluble clay leeching into the 60s' architecture which hadn't quite bucked the trend. These are the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by an incomplete set of Chinese housewives and their $5 cardigans made of refined polyester and hints of Worcester sauce. Monstrous structures built from Communist Party exuberance, host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, taint to the mistress currently tying your illegible wife to a makeshift torture device as she fires holy incense into the deepest parts of her clitoris. The artificial lakes and sprawling villages, thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, quietly moan in the whispers of future generations, packed raving into a frantic frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

<!-- Approach the house -->

Succulents and cacti of every kind, retrofit into all sorts of clay pots n' pans, braced along the newly-concreted driveway,  which had been installed out of religious purity. It's finer connections held together by particles of dust and refined palm oil, perfectly serene in it's chemical absolution.

The shed was an endless

Tiny mandarins.

I quietly slipped in through the backdoor in hopes of avoiding her entirely, knowing deep-down inside that it was merely postponing the primitive courage required to deal with the barrage of not-quite-disappoint which was certain to come my way.

<!-- Scene 2 START -->

<!-- Describe mother -->

Admittedly, I wasn't particularly keen to kick the dirt with my own mother. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap,  slathered and smeared onto the mummified corpse of a freeze-dried tibetan whore, operational only in the sheer amount of high thread-count linen required to prevent the awful stench of yesterday's lingering bamboo cookware and fermented Tuscan crustaceans from melding with your senses. I doubt you even could have called her a mother, neither in a traditional sense nor in any type of convoluted metaphor. I never loved her. I never felt anything for her, with exception to the seeping animosity which bloomed like a pond of algae, suffocating all life below. She was nothing more than a sully pair of hands, pushing and shoving me towards the human equivalent of an emotional meat-mincer. Forget the hugs and the punishing positivity, and lay welcome to our new forefathers of back-handed compliments and soul-piercing judgements. A faulty groundwork of stifling insecurity and suicidal thoughts, elegantly packaged to assist you in creatively discovering new ways to feel helpless and sad about yourself, later to be confused with the primordial lust you conjure at even the slightest sight of affection.

<!-- Describe comparison -->

A comparison board of curdled chutney to be diced and

She loved to compare. It was in her blood.

I remember she would constantly compare me. In particular, she would consistently measure my height, telling me that I would just be a bit better if only I

Somewhere deep within my core was an inescapable pocket of hardened emotion, tumbling and forming under gargantuan pressure, ready to explode at even the slightest contact of oxygen. I really hated the way she would guilt you into believing that you owed her something. That she was completely responsible for you, not realising exactly what an awful experience the whole ordeal was. The constant baiting. The expectation of never quite meeting her unrealistic standards. The worst thing she would do was compare me.

There was this one asian kid who she'd compare my grades against.

By the end of it, I didn't quite know how to feel about it all.

It was all about the beat-down.

Thankfully, she was getting old. Her greying hairs now dominating her futile attempts to stamp them out with black ink, she was too weak to control the world around her, yet completely comfortable in her incessant complaints of the world, as if the vitality of expression were an improvement within itself.

<!-- Mother Greeting -->

"You're late," responds a small upright figure, face like a porcelain horse. Spatula in hand, ready to strike at any moment. Her helper sits besides her, acute in the Stockholm complex wrapping his hooligan brain in an enticing fantasy land of denial. Neither lover, nor friend, I never quite understood the relationship the helper wore. Although he was older, married and unsuitably kind in his rhetoric, he yet preferred to spend his time in the company of cretin scum. Building. Sowing. Tending to his leash on a mortified penance of penalty and punishment. Only my mother was capable of deceiving the very basis of human evolution, raw in a pursuit of self-preservation which tore at the old white men of societies past. Especially when they were carrying her shopping.

"Why don't you ever come to see me any more? I wasted my entire life looking after you, and this is how you treat me?"

"I fucking hate you," I responded. Actually, that's not quite what I said, but it's precisely what my mouth wanted to say. Perhaps in a different universe

<!-- Describe porn usage -->

You see, kids like me didn't have mothers. We had neglected computer screens of pornstars and colourful smut, playful fun-things of deluded femininity and simulated courage. A kind of twisted fundamental truth that would allow you to twirl for hours on end, as you attempt to dangle a mammoth-sized strap-on around your knee in order to satisfy your quench for inclusion. There are no barriers. No shady cum-ridden hand to shake in a confined petrol station restroom, just to witness your first set of fake breasts. You don't even have to leave your room, let alone the shadows of your own past. It's just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into the fantastic lust-filled imagination of, providing you with your most fundamental desire to seek clarity in a world so lost with purpose. A young child sits in a room alone, awaiting cross-legged for his favourite cam girl to smile, if only to feel the warm embrace of a hug, held by his hands frantically masturbating the glowing rash developing from within his shaft. Welcome our new defacto parents of the world. An opportunity to rid the stain from your genes and introduce yourself to a new life of agrarian pleasure.

I remember participating in my first gang-bang at 12. There I was. Sitting in my chair. Brain enveloped in something magical. At first it was truly mesmerising, like placing your hand into a soulless lucky dip to find some authentic caricature of a set of laced panties. Eyes darting around the screen in a morbid photographic fixation with the imposing image of breast and triggering keywords. Fuck. Whore. XXX. The vocabulary was your play-pen. A visual casino without walls, glittering in the cerulean madness restraining you suspenseful initiation. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of constant warfare, keeping your brain intact and out of stunted order. A need. A dire situation of requirement. A lethargic reminder of your own existence, as you enclave your existence within an overwhelming bombardment of obscene destitution. Then begins the rape. The Lithuanian gang bangs. The brutality of forced-torture and poly-amorous anthropomorphism, shoved into the sweaty paws of a furry suit fit for enough disenfranchised cocks to choke a small horse to death. Orphaned children dying in a fledgling fuck-storm of medical disaster, fists shoved so deep into so many tight spaces that not even the coroner can keep up.

A small girl thigh-high tights flashes her vagina in an inconsequential display of voyeurism.

Japanese AV models were the closest thing I ever had to a mother, and it showed in the trembled lustre rotting through my kidneys.

<!-- Talk about relationship -->

Every romance was a mirage.

Anaphylactically gaping in a heaping mess of cum, tepid in the shame piling from my shaft, I cautious put away the image of my ex, frustrated in the coy optimism I promised myself hours ago never to revisit those memories again. I wasn't quite sure what kind of a future I had without my failure to function as a human being, but it managed to hold me down and actively dilute me at every possible chance. It was hard to even identify who I really was. I was uncouth.

It's probably why I refuse to have sex with an asian woman. There was no thought worse than fucking my own mother.

<!-- Father -->

I didn't know a lot about my father. He was more of a blur, than a curiosity. Admittedly it never really bothered me a great deal. It's hard to complain about something that you didn't have, and had no reference to compare to. Well, I did have my mother, and that was bad enough. Perhaps that was part of reason why I got along with dad in the short time that we were together before he had left, simply due to the misery that was mum. I guess I can't blame him, but I also can't praise him for anything he's done.


"You need to find a partner," she says.

Most of what she said usually drowned itself out into an inconsequential wave of white noise, streaming itself as quickly out of my mind as possible.


<!-- I end up breaking up, never seeing her again -->

I couldn't take it anymore. I was going to do it. My gosh, I was actually going to do it. I couldn't quite believe it, but it was finally going to happen. Ecstatic with a burst of infinite possibility, I stood up from my chair, told my mother to fuck herself, and left the room. It felt as if I'd transformed into a butterfly. I felt enummerably lighter than I did before. Calmer. More in control. At this point, I really didn't care about . For the first time in my entire life, I felt in-control.

You could tell something had changed in her.

"That's it. I've had enough get fucked."

"What do you mean you're breaking up?

Hopefully I would never have to see her again.

<!-- Scene 4 START -->

<!-- Describe Suburbs -->

Purple houses. Red parlours. Caracature crackers with an assortment of porous scars, silly with their dilly in this well sought-after town. The voice of a frail American approaches a caustic Chinese housewife, strapped with a yoga mat and a bottle of plum sauce lubricant, re-used from next door's shoot. Several cars arrive at the mansion. A camera crew and a giant dildo in the shape of a plastic dragon. The Shenzhen steel conglomeration were in for a real treat this year. Wild game, they called it. A royal competition where the wives of Communist Party leaders were wrapped inside a thick blanket of dyed red-ink, fucked with a Communist Party sponsored dildo and those that survived the 8-foot long dragon would be crowned winner, the ornament permanently lodged inside their vagina. The civility was bare, although I doubt they could have ever imagined it any other way. The pacing was off, for sure.

<!-- Train Ride Back -->

Although I could feel myself gasping at the recklessness of my actions, there was also something quite magical about the calm tingle of the rush that had persisted till now. Like a giant dove carrying me in a wet drove of uncertainty, as the country-bound train forced itself along the motionless barren tracks, facilitating my desire to simply shut down and remove myself from the world. Was I bad person? Did I inflict harm onto others? Do I even have a choice. It felt as if I was part of some kind of definitive cycle of abusive psychopaths and manipulative low-lives, born out of a never-ending chain of bad parenting and alcohol abuse. I guess everyone wants to be 'the one' who breaks the cycle, but whether that were even humanely possible, I couldn't say for sure.

I closed my laptop and broke down in a tidal wave of tears and emotion. Maybe the lady sitting in front of me would even find the sensitivity attractive, before propositioning to hold me and later provide me with a cheeky hand-job in the latter part of the carriage. And if only I weren't such a good liar. It was just me alone in this brightly-lit space. Trapped with all the time in the world to think less of my uncontrollable actions.
