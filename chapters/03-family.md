<!-- Describe reproduction -->

A ten-ounce packet o' Hershey's sperm is all it takes a to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big ol' sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the pseudoephedrine-encapsulated collaborations encrusting the outline of your mother's vagina. A relative cum dumpster of fire and frothy regret. Crunch n' sizzle bitches, groan in the delirious mannequin coquette causing you to screech in hallowing pleasure, daffle at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in post-war self-abuse and the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes and valid have been generously funded by the Catholic Cum Laude and their pack of Irish henchmen. And for the almost inconspicuous price of college admission, it only takes an entire hoard of sperm to push n' pull through our beautiful fuck-thing, as our dashing pre-star surrounds herself in the presence of anxious young men, pumped full of imitation testosterone and a natural tendency for the knucklehead life. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea-inspired holes designed only to generously fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between Russian lit lectures.

<!-- Describe suburbs -->

I always wondered if I'd have a piece of this one day, as I stared out of the graffiti'd glaze of the train windows ahead and into the rolling hills of splendor, surrounded by the lush green crust which upholds the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options breathing life into the thick insoluble clay leeching into the 60s' architecture which hadn't quite bucked the trend. These are the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by an incomplete set of Chinese housewives and their $5 cardigans made of refined polyester and hints of Worchester sauce. Monstrous structures built from Communist Party exuberance, host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, taint to the mistress currently tying your illegible wife to a makeshift torture device as she fires holy incense into the deepest parts of her clitoris. The artificial lakes and sprawling villages, thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, quietly moan in the whispers of future generations, packed raving into a frantic frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

<!-- Describe mother -->

Admittedly, I wasn't particularly keen to kick the dirt with my own mother. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap,  slathered and smeared onto the mummified corpse of a freeze-dried tibetan whore, operational only in the sheer amount of high thread-count linen required to prevent the awful stench of yesterday's lingering bamboo cookware and fermented Tuscan crustaceans from melding with your senses. I doubt you even could have called her a mother, neither in a traditional sense nor in any type of convoluted metaphor. I never loved her. I never felt anything for her, with exception to the seeping animosity which bloomed like a pond of algae, suffocating all life below. She was nothing more than a sully pair of hands, pushing and shoving me towards the human equivalent of an emotional meat-mincer. Forget the hugs and the punishing positivity, and lay welcome to our new forefathers of back-handed compliments and soul-piercing judgements. A faulty groundwork of stifling insecurity and suicidal thoughts, elegantly packaged to assist you in creatively discovering new ways to feel helpless and sad about yourself, later to be confused with the primordial lust you conjure at even the slightest sight of affection. Thankfully, she was getting old. Her greying hairs now dominating her futile attempts to stamp them out with black ink, she was too weak to control the world around her, yet completely comfortable in her incessant complaints of the world, as if the vitality of expression were an improvement within itself.

<!-- Describe porn -->

You see, kids like me didn't have mothers. We had porn. An enticing fantasy land of courage and strength. The kind of fundamental truth you could twirl for hours on end, as you dangle a strap-on around your knee in order to satisfy your quench for inclusion. There are no barriers. No shady cum-ridden hand to shake in a confined petrol station restroom, just to witness your first set of fake breasts. You don't even have to leave your room, let alone the shadows of your own past. It's just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into the fantastic lust-filled imagination of, providing you with your most fundamental desire to seek clarity in a world so lost with purpose. A young child sits in a room alone, awaiting cross-legged for his favourite cam girl to smile, if only to feel the warm embrace of a hug, held by his hands frantically masturbating the glowing rash developing from within his shaft. Welcome our new defacto parents of the world. An opportunity to rid the stain from your genes and introduce yourself to a new life of agrarian pleasure. I remember participating in my first gang-bang at 12. There I was. Sitting in my chair. Brain enveloped in something magical. At first it was truly mesmerising, like placing your hand into a souless lucky dip to find some authentic caricature of a set of laced panties. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of constant warfare, keeping your

<!-- Describe interaction with mother, as well as house -->

Succulents and cacti of every kind brace the newly-concreted driveway held together by particles of dust and refined palm oil, a perfecting serene in it's chemical absolution. I quietly slip in through the backdoor in hopes of being unnoticed until at least I managed to make it into the living room where I've garnered enough courage not to grab her face and grate it against the hard brick walls of the .

It's probably why I refuse to have sex with an asian woman. It would be too much like fucking my own mother.


Eyes darting around the screen in a morbid photographic fixation with the imposing image of breast and triggering keywords. Fuck. Whore. XXX. The vocabulary was your play-pen. A visual casino without walls, glittering in the cerulean madness restraining you suspenseful initiation. Next minute you're dashing down the street, holding a laptop in one hand with a sandwich in the other, kickin' the leash of glory to

Hopefully I would never have to see her again.
