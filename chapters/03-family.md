<!-- Describe the house -->

One sperm is all it takes a to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the Pseudoephedrine encapsulated collaborations causing you to screech in hallowing pleasure at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in post-war self-abuse and the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes and valid and fully-funded by the Catholic cum delegation and their pack of Irish henchmen. And yet the great thing about lust is that your odds increase dramatically the more biological dice you decide to roll. For an almost inconspicuous price of admission, an entire hoard of sperm is all it takes to push and pull our beautiful fuck-thing through at least the early phases of college, as our dashing pre-star surrounds herself by a pack of anxious young men, pumped full of imitation testosterone and a natural tendency for knucklehead behaviour. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea inspired holes designed only to generously fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between lit lectures.

"One day I'll have a piece of this," I remarked to myself, as I stared out of the train window into the rolling hills of splendor, surrounded by the lush green crust which upholds the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options breathing life into the thick insoluble clay leeching industrial minerals, begins the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by the flimsy housewives wearing $5 cardigans made of refined polyester. Monstrous structures built from Chinese Communist Party exuberance, host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, taint to the mistress currently tying your illegible wife to a makeshift torture device firing holy incense into her vagina. The artificial lakes and sprawling villages, thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, quietly moaning future generations into a frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

<!-- Describe mother -->

Admittedly I wasn't particularly keen to see my mother, if you could even call her that. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap, her most prominent features smeared and plastered onto the mummified child of a deep-frozen tibetan whore, operational only in the sheer amount of maintenance required to prevent the awful stench of Bamboo cookware and dried seafood

Truth is that I never loved my mother. Nor was she much of a mother in the traditional sense. She was nothing more than a

Forget the hugs and the positive reinforces, because we have a new player in town. Oh, so you don't like back-handed compliments? How splendid, because now we'll also pay someone else to do it for you. Sunday tutoring. An elegant way to create sadness from boredom, later to be confused with primordial lust.

 welcome to the grind of Sunday tutoring and saxophone lessons,

She was solely a source of anxiety, a pair of hands to help cook meals and scold. Love, of course, being the feeling.

Kids like me didn't have mothers. We had porn. An enticing fantasy land of courage and strength. The kind of fundamental truth you could twirl for hours on end, as you dangle a strap-on around your knee in order to satisfy your quench for inclusion. There are no barriers. No shady cum-ridden hand to shake in a confined petrol station restroom, just to witness your first set of fake breasts. You don't even have to leave your room, let alone the shadows of your own past. It's just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into the fantastic lust-filled imagination of, providing you with your most fundamental desire to seek clarity in a world so lost with purpose.

A young child sits in a room alone, awaiting cross-legged for his favourite cam girl to smile, if only to feel the warm embrace of a hug, held by his hands frantically masturbating the glowing rash developing from within his shaft. Welcome our new defacto parents of the world. An opportunity to rid the stain from your genes and introduce yourself to a new life of agrarian pleasure. I remember participating in my first gang-bang at 12. There I was. Sitting in my chair. Brain enveloped in something magical.

At first it was truly mesmerising, like placing your hand into a souless lucky dip to find some authentic caricature of a set of laced panties. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of constant warfare, keeping your

I quietly slip in,

A small upright figure enters the room, face like a porcelain horse.

Eyes darting around the screen in a morbid photographic fixation with the imposing image of breast and triggering keywords. Fuck. Whore. XXX. The vocabulary was your play-pen. A visual casino without walls, glittering in the cerulean madness restraining you suspenseful initiation. Next minute you're dashing down the street, holding a laptop in one hand with a sandwich in the other, kickin' the leash of glory to

Talk about the guilt you feel as a son.
