### Reproduction Introduction

A ten-ounce packet o' Hershey's sperm. That's all it takes to ruin a household. One faulty dig into nature's great big ol' sack of genetic fanaticism, splendid within the pseudoephedrine-encapsulated collaborations encrusting the outline of your mother's vagina. A relative cum dumpster of fire and pre-maritime froth; father's permanent residence of industrial-strength facial cream. Cinematic in a netherworld of tartarus condemnation, eroding the hopes and dreams of our children not yet born.

Pickle n' loam at the coquette mannequin obliging you to screech in hallowing pleasure, daffle at the primal misery you fuck like peppermint candy. Involving a three-year technical specialisation in al fresco self-abuse, along with the practical mastery of an erroneous puppet, your fortunes have been generously funded by the Catholic Cum Laude and their pack of Irish henchmen. And for an almost inconspicuous price of college admission, a thirty-two-ounce bucket of ejaculate is all it takes to push n' pull through our beautiful fuck-thing, as our dashing pre-star announces herself in the presence of a cascade of young men. Pumped full of imitation testosterone in a panoramic anxiety of knucklehead casualty. A daring challenge for a new generation of Ikea-inspired holes designed only to fit three fingers and a vape kit for use in-between Russian lit lectures.

### Describe suburbs

I always wondered if I'd have a piece of this one day, as I stared out of the train window and into the rolling hills of splendor. The lush green crust which upheld the mountains of concrete and inflated stock options, breathing dust into the brown insoluble clay of the first people's home. Monstrous 60s' Brutalism. Communist Party Exuberance. These were the amiable foundings of a worthy few, perched by an incomplete set of Chinese housewives and their $5 cardigans made of refined polyester, stained with hints of Worcester sauce. They were pure amalgamations of smog and flesh for the lungs to gorge, and the heart to deny. The artificial lakes. The sprawling villages. The orange provocative. Host to an extravagant marble display of finger-lickin' grandeur, thrust manic through a vision which holds itself together in fake competition, moaning anguish at the avaricious cancer it identifies as growth. Prams constructed of recycled children, moan in quiet whispers for future generations to beware. Their tiny arms and legs, packed ravage in a frantic frenzy of kleptocratic privilege. A homeless man wearing a gold, jade necklace, has his cock erect at the thought of dinner. It was a demented hound of global atrocity; a facade upon which stitched the delicate fabric of the Chinese upper-middle class and their lofty ideals.

### Describe Rich Chinese

The 21st Century Asian was a fickle creature which did not need what it saw, and only wanted what it was told. A Hollywood bonanza! of Western desires, labored inside a steel-reinforced inferiority complex constructed since birth. A base-model Mercedes Benz masked by the smell of a daughter's fetus, baked in the backseat on a hot summer's day. A council of status for the grey Asian men stalking the streets with a lead pipe and a desire for hard liquor. Wifebeater on. Military haircut engaged. Cigarette in ear. Toothpick in hand. Teeth in gangrene. Legs spread wide around a plate of Hungarian cheese, slopped around the mouth with a dollop of hoisin sauce. A walking, high-rise anatomy of plastic duty, paid in sex and cheap dinner meals. Just like mother ordered when Chiang Kai Shek and his gang, kicked down her front doors and raped her in a yellow collective. Oh, how me so sorry.

### Approach the house

As I approached the rickety gate of the unkept weatherboard estate, I couldn't help but notice the surreal elongation of it all. The eroded panels of elasticised walnut, flourishing in a chemical absolution of sanctified degrade. Consent to wither and perish. Thistles the size of cabins, entrenching their positions along the brick parchment and bringing kingdom to the rodents whom invented war and religion. Succulents and cacti of every kind, retrofit into an assortment of smashed pots and non-stick pans, braced along a poorly-paved driveway held together by particles of cinder and refined palm oil. The quell horror of the tantamount ground soak, schisming beneath me in a seizure of tumble and decay. Raring to swallow me into it's posture of resolute forgiveness. The front facade of the house truly was a postmodern construction site for the aggrieved. A sick sympathy of existence, praying at the border for a distinct ethos to arrive and wash it all away. I quietly made my fetter along the house, slipping in through the backdoor in the hopes of being avoided, knowing deep-down inside that I was merely postponing the primitive courage required to deal with the barrage of not-quite disappoint which was certain to come my way. This was the house of my mother.

### Describe mother

Admittedly, I wasn't particularly keen to kick the dirt with my mother. A coarse judgement of moistureless tree-sap, slathered and smeared onto the mummified corpse of a freeze-dried Tibetan whore. Operational only in the sheer amount of high thread-count linen required to prevent the awful stench of yesterday's lingering bamboo cookware and fermented Tuscan crustaceans from melding with your soul. I doubt you even could have called her a mother, either in a traditional sense, nor in convoluted metaphor. I never loved her. I never understood her. I never really felt anything for her, with exception to the seeping animosity which bloomed like a pond of algae, suffocating all life below. She was nothing more than a sully pair of hands, pushing and shoving me towards the human equivalent of an emotional meat-grinder. Forget the hugs and the encouraging positivity, and lay welcome to our new forefathers, the King of back-handed compliments and the Queen of soul-piercing atrophy. A faulty groundwork of stifling insecurity and suicidal thoughts, elegantly packed into a used condom to assist you in creatively discovering new ways to feel helpless and contrived, later to be confused with the primordial lust you conjure at even the slightest sight of affection. Your brain and me, voted most likely to part ways and never speak again. Put simply, she was never around to care.

### Describe comparison

She was a woman who loved to compare. An advisory board of curdled chutney, to be diced and sautéed into a Crème brûlée of pickling torment. It was in her blood to persecute, dement and imprison. To embrace the thin strands of judgement coursing through her arteries in an ephemeral stew of caustic joy. I was never good enough by design. My intellect. My genetics. My innate ability to feel. All notable concerns on the creaky prize-wheel of informal assessment, carefully decomposed in a decree of supple factuality. Caught in an unending loop of fatal incomprehension. It was her duty to insistently measure and customise my self-esteem to her privy attention, iterating my existence so that I could better fit her ideal image of a son, if only so I could just be that little bit more unobtainably taller. The awe and beauty of a broken leaf, crisp in a vat of blistering expectation, trapped inside her matrix of unrealistic criterion. Holding on, only by the synapses taunting you awake.

Thankfully, she was getting old. A former shell of the wrath which she bore within. Her greying hairs, now dominating her unremitting attempts to remain relevant. Eyes like an aging tiger. Too weak to control the world around her, yet so completely comfortable in the conviction she wore with pride. A cunt with a duck for a face.

## Scene 2 START

### Mother Greeting

"You're late!", larks a small upright figure, face like a porcelain horse. Spatula in hand. Ready to strike at the given.

"I fucking hate you," I respond in an immediate thrash of anger. Actually, that wasn't quite what I said. It was more a moment of silence, if anything. An acknowledgement of the situation in civil terms, even though I could feel the outline of those words seep from my mouth, in a desperate attempt for oxidation, prophecised to enact justice on thy foe. An impalpable excuse to knock her out with my bare hands, and throw her stunned corpse into a wood chippery disguised as a retirement home. Chirpity. Chirp. Chip. If only I could find a way to mask the awful stench of pre-historic white dick emanating from her pussy. That unbearable cauliflower smear which housed semen from the late 1940s'. Then and only then might I have worked up the courage to approach her in vain.

And without remise, kneeling in faithful gratitude at the helm, was her helper. A frail Estonian man. Mr. Stockholm. The lord of preach and denial. Older, married and unsuitably kind. Neither lover, nor friend. Neither quaint, nor pretend. A farce. Amend. I never quite understood the relationship that the helper wore, only that he was one and she was infinity. The kind of doe-daddy calculation that would make even the most abstract mathematicians want to cry. An adoration of cretin scum. Building. Sowing. Fortifying his leash on a mortified penance of penalty and punishment. A deception of human evolution. A carrier of shopping bags. Fall.

"Why don't you come to see me anymore? I'm your mother, you should treat me better." I suppose that summarised our relationship. A mechanical exchange of contracts and titles, quantified by your ability to cease and desist. An offer in one hand. Your life in the next. A sacred punishment which regressed itself as a motherly love, without the love, nor the necessity. Another sad case of right time, wrong hole. Dull me, honey.

### Describe porn usage

Then in a sudden whirlwind of anchored correspondence, it became unreasonably clear to me that the woman standing in front of my very eyes was nothing more than a ruse. A pseudo-salad concoction of infallible consumption, shoved so far down my throat that I could barely even taste the difference between my own plain and pleasure. It had become apparent in my eyes that my true mother was in fact the one thing which I'd spent most my life abhorring. The gentle brothel of care which had kept me engaged with my own life, far more pronounced than she ever did. My computer screen. A place for meals to be relished without the incessant precaution of judgement, where my feelings of inadequacy could be washed away in a pixel haze of hyperphallic euphoria. Stretched like a taut violin. Laced and chewed with paranoia. In a wholeful neglect of deluded femininity. A static interaction of colourful smut. Click. Click. Crunch. Curated communities of mutilated chests and cosplay vaginas, dangled as a wholesome cure for the crippling anxiety you construct by the mouthful. The totality of your vision wanes into an attrition of befuddled harmony, as you attempt to surmount a mammoth-sized strap-on onto your child-sized knee. Satisfying your quench for cradled inclusion, diluted in a fire of self-hate and glorification. Waxing in glee, correctively at ease.

The screen was a world away from the ancient cum-ridden rituals of blowing some fat-fuck inside the confines of a gas station restroom, just to witness your first set of silicone breasts on the centre-fold of some greasy Playboy magazine. Hell, you didn't even have to leave your own bedroom, let alone the auspices of your own shame. The screen was just there. 24/7. Happy to guide you into a fantastic lust-filled self-proclamation of sex and whore, tweaking your most fundamental ambitions into an indecent inclination for cinematic nudity and makeshift affection. A young child sits cross-legged in a room alone, awaiting the online presence of his favourite cam girl. Sad. Moan. If only to feel the warm embrace of her smile, as he masturbates frantically in a glowing rash of pampered silence. And thus, we welcome our new defacto parents to the world. A semi-pregnant teenager with a face-tattoo for a passport. A glamourous opportunity to rid the stain from our genes and introduce ourselves to a new life of agrarian pleasure. My brain enveloped in something magical. The pinch of my sticky fingers clamoured together in a witness of unholy relegation. Burnt like bleached popsicles. Covered in the pornographic titillation I ravaged in isolation, as my mother gargled white dick in the bedroom over. Who'd knew you could develop an OCD for sucking cock. Perhaps I would be next.

So there I was. Sitting at my desk. Participating in my first gang-bang at the age of 12. At first it was mesmerising. Your eyes, captured in lore, dart around the screen in a morbid fixation with the keywords triggering you into an untimely calamity of horrific resplendence. Fuck. Whore. Death. A small girl in thigh-high tights flashes her vagina in an inconsequential display of voyeurism. It is class. You are class. Glittering in the cerulean madness restraining your craving for quantum initiation. Then it becomes routine. A bashful kingdom of vaseline warfare, keeping your brain intact through a stunted phase of disrepair. A need. A requirement. A lethargic reminder of your own existence, as you enclave your mind in an overwhelming bombardment of obscene destitution. Then begins the rape. The Lithuanian chokeholds. The brutality of forced-torture and poly-amorous anthropomorphism, tossed into the sweaty paws of a pedophile in a furry suit, designed to fit enough disenfranchised cocks to murder a small horse. Orphaned children dying in a fledgling fuck-storm of medical disaster, fists shoved so deep into so many unrecognisable tight spaces that not even the coroner can keep up. This was life, and life was me. We were one, so go run free.

### Eat lunch with my mother

The vintage oak dining table, a testament to slave craftmanship, reached out towards a broken family of none. The helper sat with his ankles tied in a handcuff knot of submissive apprehension, agitated in the scars he picked from his face in an imperfect spiral of manic indecisive. His long fingers tenderly curled, clutching a pair of chopsticks which bore the word 'slave' in traditional Chinese. I didn't know what to say to him in the linger of conversation, other than to shrewdly poke my eyes at the way he would sneak ounces of snuff into his gums, as he began to yearn in a smitten barm of deranged twitching. The confidence in his eyes, hemorrhaging draino by the trench full. It wasn't safe to be around.

"Why you not help bring food to table?"

"Alright, calm down."

"Don't tell me to calm down! I am your mother! Now you go get food!"

Carrying back a bowl of rice, rested below a mixed variety of dried fish and roasted porcupine, sat my demeanour for a second time at the table, next to the helper, now passed out in a nicotine mist of hoarfrost. The pickling cabbage and black bean sauce slurry, ladden with enough dehydrated corn flour to kill a small child. Patiently waiting for mother to arrive. Then she sits. And we eat. And not a word more was said, nor could be predicted by the harrowing radars of the north seas, commissioned to detect even the slightest hint of judgement from the cadaverous woman of cree. The rice entered my mouth, stewing inside my gums. Tumbling against my tastebuds. Learning how best to cope with the excessive salts and sours beseiging my tongue. Enveloping into an ulcer of dyspepsic saturation, as I continued to sit there in a spire of modern arcadia, mind prefixed on grabbing mother's face and shredding it along the brick wall outside. Usually, we didn't speak. The only time we spoke was when we argued about something, usually so she could tell me off or criticise me for not being more like her. Just what every son wants to hear.

### Father

Admittedly, I didn't know a lot about my father. He was more of a blur, than a curiosity. A seismic event which brought about my creation, that never really amounted to anything beyond day zero. A constant scapegoat for all my failures. I suppose it never really bothered me a great deal. It's hard to bother about something that's not there. No one to blame. No one to praise. A bad meal at a pub at Wednesday prices. A Madonna print without a genuine signature. Rather, I was my own father. My own role model. My own piece of shit to be moulded into a Cambridge English Dictionary of hysteric approximations, to be sold at fire sale prices to people who barely understand the value of language. Epithet. You. Shall.

"You need to find a partner! When you find partner!?", she blurts, fish-bone stuck between her two front teeth. Awaiting some kind of lengthly apology for my existence.

"I don't know," was how I usually responded to her antics. In most cases, I simply tried my best to transpose her complaints into a stream of white noise. Checkered waves of tampered dystopia, leaving my mind as quickly as they had entered. Inspite of my rapid-set cynicism, I'd always carried a sense of hope that one day she would change, and experience some sort of miasma of clarity that would completely flush her brain, and allow her to trutly understand how to severely unfuck the caged dwadiness of her own insanity. Instead, her mind seemed more liked a hotpot of sharpnel, forever combusting into ever-smaller pieces that would eventually seep into the insides of her lungs, and cause her to gaff in a choking fit of hardened-cum and arsenal currency exchange.

Then it hit me. The epiphany. The realisation. The stature. There I was. Suspended in time. My vision as plain as it had been since the onset of my birth. The rise of empowerment. The shore of distaste. Who even was this women, and who was I to put up with her garish games? What power did she have over me, other than the common title which she spruiked in confine and maxim? What resulted was an inescapable pocket of caked emotion, tumbling and forming under the tipsy dissonance of dichotomist refactor. Fraught with relegation, reorganising itself at even the slightest hint of opposition. The beat-down was real and I was ready to represent.

"Do you not care!? Why are you so stupid!?" I couldn't take it anymore. The sound of her voice. The nature of her everything. I was going to do it. My gosh, I was actually going to do it, and for the first time in life, I was absolutely dying to see how she would respond. With an ecstatic grin, I stand up from my chair, point my finger at her face, and I tell her to go fuck herself.

"Go fuck yourself," I shout.

It was the kind of statement which reverberated through the air, knocking down the ancient structures of tradition and trust which had been upheld for so long, that no one even quite knew what to do once they were gone. It even woke the helper up from his deep slumber, whom in a terrorised panic, ran towards the pantry and locked himself away in a shivering hiding. The corresponding silence was deafening. She was speechless. Nothing could assist her in rectifying the situation, as she mentally scanned through the millions of backhanded compliments and off-putting phrases awash in her mind. Realising there was nothing within her power which would allow to take control of this situation. She was lost. Buried alive under the height of her arrogance. Confusion which soon defaulted to anger, in a last-ditch attempt to save the empire which she'd fought so hard and for so long to maintain. An iron fist turned to rust. The weight of her ignorance, dissolving around my shoulders and setting me free. And as much as she wanted to scream and shout, the words simply wouldn't come out. A woman no more.

### Describe Suburbs

Purple houses. Red parlours. Caricature crackers in an assortment of porous scars. Well sought-after delicacies with mini tasers for appetisers. The frail voice of an American senior approaches an ordinary Chinese housewife, strapped with a yoga mat and an aging bottle of plum sauce. Rubbed in the scent of the raw documents outlining his death will. The perfect aphrodisiac for any immigrant to begin gushing from their vagina in an unvoluntary orgasm known to kill. Paralysed in a shaking puddle of oriental discharge, eyes quivering beyond the human spectrum, overloaded with ejaculate. Pronounced dead at 1:21pm midday. Death from white privilege.

-->

Several cars arrive at an opulent mansion, garden decorated in a topiary mess of yellow dandelions and white pebble. Tennessee horticulture with a Chinese know-how. A camera crew appears from a grimey meat van, holding a giant metal dildo in the shape of a plastic dragon, caramelised in an aluminium canvas of scheduled statement. The family of the Shenzhen Steel Conglomeration were in for a real treat this year. Wild game, they called it. A royal competition where the wives of Communist Party leaders were shrouded in a craggy blankets stolen from the deased bodies of Japanese revolutionaries, to be fucked with a symbolic dildo. And those that survived the 8-foot long dragon would be crowned general secretary of their local party branch. With the ornament to be permanently lodged inside their vagina. The civility was bare, although I doubt they could have ever imagined it any other way. The pacing was off, for sure.

### Train Ride Back

Although I could feel myself gasping at the recklessness of my actions, there was also something quite magical about the calm tingle of the rush that had persisted till now. Like a giant dove carrying me in a wet drove of uncertainty, as the country-bound train forced itself along the motionless barren tracks, facilitating my desire to simply shut down and remove myself from the world. Was I bad person? Did I inflict harm onto others? Do I even have a choice. It felt as if I was part of some kind of definitive cycle of abusive psychopaths and manipulative low-lives, born out of a never-ending chain of bad parenting and alcohol abuse. I guess everyone wants to be 'the one' who breaks the cycle, but whether that were even humanely possible, I couldn't say for sure.

I closed my laptop and broke down in a tidal wave of tears and emotion. Maybe the lady sitting in front of me would even find the sensitivity attractive, before propositioning to hold me and later provide me with a cheeky hand-job in the latter part of the carriage. And if only I weren't such a good liar. It was just me alone in this brightly-lit space. Trapped with all the time in the world to think less of my uncontrollable actions.
