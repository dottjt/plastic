## Scene 1 START

### Leaving the apartment

Thirty-fuck. The trixie air slams it's hairy coon into the back of my neck, travelling across my cheek in a fastidious rain of filched indiscriminate. Season's greeting, you cunt. Streaks of lightning jilt n' tither across my jaw, throwing my twirl into a pirouette rotation of cross-examination. Two fingers enter my mouth, suckling the impressionable membrame of my gums. A protruding lump. I picture my favourite stripper wearing a U.S.A. theme bikini outfit. Parading her fake tits like a deranged rapist. I was cold. The air was fresh and I was cold. Too cold for the flimsy balcony supporting the weight of these two feet, along with the 150 something others whom lived in this apartment block. A concrete tell-tale of Dicken's brick and 60s' labour. My breath smelt like shit, and I was going to show it. Joint in hand. Ready to roll. Maybe that's just what the writer's flair was all about. Keep it classy, cumberbatch.

### Woman appears / Describe neighbourhood

A woman appears from the staircase, carrying what seems to be a large stack of boxes. Yet I could not identify her. I assumed she lived on this floor, so how had I not judged or sized her before? At the end of the hall was the DND nerd, whom both simultaneously looked and smelt as if he'd both showered every single day, and had never showered a single day at all in his life. A staple income for the rug n' tug a few blocks down. Was that seventy with mouth, or am I also expected to grant a visa to your poor cousin as well? Next to him was the woman in the turquoise mini-van. A scathing lump of intrepid witchery. A face mask for the ugly and poor. Not old enough to be retired, not pretty enough to be a cam girl, yet was always turtled at home. Scheming. Possibly braiding the outskirts of her vagina with a hot iron, in a gesture of guilt for the way life treated her. Those certainly weren't designer lips.

### Describe woman

The first thing I noticed was the silky black texture of the skin on her arms. Worn without crown, delegating the rapier luminosity of elegance she clearly held without noticing, which simply flowed from her long curly hair and down to her hips. I was mesmerised. I wanted more. I had become corrupt. She stumbled towards me in an exhaled gaff of sweat, in her collossal attempt to haul this thing up 16 flights of stairs. Placing the boxes down on the ground in complete exhaustion, revealing the rest of her face and body. She was gorgeous, and I was me. I suppose the least I could was flirt with her, especially now that she was at her weakest.

"Hey, do you need hand with that? I'm just from down the hall," I offered, sounding barely genuine in my stoned hunger. Clearly offering more than just a rag of sincere physical extrapolation. I mean, I was wearing stained track pants for god's sake. I was either a hermit or a pedophile. Possibly both.

"Yeah, sure! That would be great, thank you. I just need it in through here." I loved the striking confidence in her voice. The way it knew what it wanted, without demanding anything from you. I loved the way her mouth hovered over her words, like a lallygag of harmless spiders pouring from a punctured sac of extradition. Tickling their prey into a folly of submission. It was a bright arpeggio of inspired direction. The one thing I was sorely needing in life. She opens her scratched-up apartment door, conveniently inbetween to the incessant string fiddler and the hawk-eyed pickler, two of my of least-liked tennants. I'm pretty sure they both liked to scissor, like a pack of squirmy love-hens. A bloody waste, I say.

### Enter her apartment

The door swung open and a whole new world revealed itself to the mainstay discoure of my mind. Projector's everywhere. Screens of all different kinds. A litter of topography upon the foundations of her apartment. Vintage devices from the earliest of industrialisation. Cathode Ray Tubes of antiqued design. Bundled in crate's of two near a flourishing African blood lily in the corner of the room, spittig it's frazzled pollen onto a litter of large aperature lens, teaming with dust. She was a classy hoarder, if ever you could describe such a thing.

"Oh, so I see you like screens?", I remarked, taken aback by the museum of historic memorabillia ingesting my vision.

"Yeah, it's become a bit of an obsession of mine. I'm a bit of a cinema archivist, if I don't say myself." She ended her sentence with a bright up-ticket in her word. I couldn't tell if she was in denial, or if she was open about her disorder, although either way the sex was going to be great. A splay of horrific restlessness as I dug my fingers deep into her skin, as I fucked her in vehement arousal, shoving my foot in her asshole and hearing her scream. I really needed to pull it together, but it was hard with my mind where it was. I placed the large box down next to the couch, pretending as if I just didn't slightly pull my hamstring and everything was just fine.

"Would you like something to drink?" Yes. Yes, I would.

### Chat on the couch

We both sat on the couch and began chatting casually about our lives. The struggles. The nuances. The stupid neighbours next door. What we loved and abhorred. She felt both real and exciting. More than just a tack on the wall. A woman with intelligence and character. Who made me feel more than just another card to be played. The whiteness of her teeth. Her oversized prescription glasses. Part of me couldn't stop noticing the iridescence of her eyes, contrast against the scintillating blackness of her face. It was like staring at the nebulous surface of an unfinished cup of coffee, swirling in tandem against the chocolately surface of the aromatic blend. I think she liked me. Apparently if a girl looks at your lips three times it means she wants to kiss you, and I was certain that she wanted my tongue. Of course, we were neighbours and I was about as self-assured as a wet sock. But at least I was honest with myself.

"Oh, so you're a writer. That's super cool! I wish I could write, but I don't seem to be good at anything. Although I have a lot of knowledge about film." She turns her body towards my direction, parlous in the docile nature of her proportionate body.

I receive a text. "I look forward to tonight xoxo". My temperature rose. Shit. Tonight's date with Milo. I'd completely forgot, or perhaps repressed, my scheduled escort with the devil. I suppose I couldn't have both women cavort my lap, rubbing my pre-cum into the flouncing creases of my pants.

"Anyway, it was nice to meet you, but I better to head off," I noted, concerned whether I was even going to make it to her apartment on time. It was already 5pm and I had no idea how to get there, let alone decide what I was going to wear. Maybe she preferred the drug-fucked look of a man covered in the scent of a poorly received six-pack, now wreaking havoc with the odour of his shirt some many weeks later.

"Thanks for your help. It was really kind of you. Feel free to pop round, maybe we could watch a movie together?"

"Yes. I would love that." I wasn't sure if what I said came across as being needy, however it was genuinely how I felt. An overwhelming sense of warmth and connection, which transcended well-beyond her thorough intelligence and marvelous attraction. It was a sense of connection that I'd never felt before. She was the one that I wanted to be with. Of course, as per usual, I wasn't sure if I'd simply become delusional

She walked me out to the front, waving with a smitten smile attached to her face, as I left her apartment in a giddy of infatuation. Maria was her name. As beautiful as beauty could be.
