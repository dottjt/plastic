## Scene 1 START

### Leaving the apartment

Thirty-fuck. The trixie air slams it's hairy coon into the back of my neck, travelling across my cheek in a fastidious rain of filched indiscriminate. Season's greeting, you cunt. Streaks of lightning jilt n' tither across my jaw, throwing my twirl into a pirouette rotation of cross-examination. Two fingers enter my mouth, suckling the impressionable membrame of my gums. A protruding lump. I picture my favourite stripper wearing a U.S.A. theme bikini outfit. Parading her fake tits like a deranged rapist. I was cold. The air was fresh and I was cold. Too cold for the flimsy balcony supporting the weight of these two feet, along with the 150 something others whom lived in this apartment block. A concrete tell-tale of Dicken's brick and 60s' labour. My breath smelt like shit, and I was going to show it. Joint in hand. Ready to roll. Maybe that's just what the writer's flair was all about. Keep it classy, cumberbatch.

### Woman appears / Describe neighbourhood

A woman appears from the staircase, carrying what seems to be a large stack of boxes. Yet I could not identify her. I assumed she lived on this floor, so how had I not judged or sized her before? At the end of the hall was the DND nerd, whom both simultaneously looked and smelt as if he'd both showered every single day, and had never showered a single day at all in his life. A staple income for the rug n' tug a few blocks down. Was that seventy with mouth, or am I also expected to grant a visa to your poor cousin as well? Next to him was the woman in the turquoise mini-van. A scathing lump of intrepid witchery. A face mask for the ugly and poor. Not old enough to be retired, not pretty enough to be a cam girl, yet was always turtled at home. Scheming. Possibly braiding the outskirts of her vagina with a hot iron, in a gesture of guilt for the way life treated her. Those certainly weren't designer lips.

### Describe woman

The first thing I noticed was the silky black texture of the skin on her arms. Worn without crown, delegating the rapier luminosity of elegance she clearly held without noticing, which simply flowed from her long curly hair and down to her hips. I was mesmerised. I wanted more. I had become corrupt. She stumbled towards me in an exhaled gaff of sweat, in her collossal attempt to haul this thing up 16 flights of stairs. Placing the boxes down on the ground in complete exhaustion, revealing the rest of her face and body. She was gorgeous. Her oversized prescription glasses with a large black rim. The whole package serene. I suppose the least I could was flirt with her, especially now that she was at her weakest.

"Hey, do you need hand with that? I'm just from down the hall," I offered, sounding barely genuine in my stoned hunger. Clearly offering more than just a rag of sincere physical extrapolation. I mean, I was wearing stained track pants for god's sake. I was either a hermit or a pedophile. Possibly both.

"Yeah, sure! That would be great, thank you. I just need it in through here." I loved the striking confidence in her voice. The way it knew what it wanted, without demanding anything from you. It was a bright arpeggio of inspired direction. The one thing I was sorely needing in life. She opens her scratched-up apartment door, conveniently inbetween to the incessant string fiddler and the hawk-eyed pickler, two of my of least-liked tennants. I'm pretty sure they both liked to scissor, like a pack of squirmy love-hens. A bloody waste, I say.

### Enter her apartment

The door swung open and a whole new world revealed itself to the mainstream discoure of my mind. Projector's everywhere. Screens of all different kinds. Littering the topography of her apartment. Vintage devices from the earliest of industrial life. Cathode Ray Tubes of antiqued design, bundled in a crate near a flourishing African blood lily.

"Oh, so I see you like screens," I remarked, taken aback by the museum of historic memorabillia ingesting my vision.

"Yeah, it's become a bit of an obsession of mine. I am a cinema aficionado, after all."

I loved the way her mouth hovered over her words, like a lallygag of harmless spiders pouring from a punctured sac into the. Tickling their prey into

She turned her body towards my direction,
