## Scene 1 START

### Help Monologue

Hi. Have we met before? I know we probably haven't met before, but it's really nice to meet you. I like your hair. I think it's pretty. The way it flows. I definitely think we're going to get along. I'm probably sounding cheesy, but I feel that you're not quite like the others. You have a really beautiful smile and I really like the way your eyes blink. I think it's classy. Oh, and I promise not to sexualise you. As of this very moment, I've decided to take the time to write to you. To admire you. To bring you to life. Really, I spend most of my free time writing, and it's something I really enjoy doing. Hopefully enough to inspire others to write, although I'm not sure if that's such a good idea. You might even call me a writer, not that I do it for a living. It's just something that helps me feel a little more ...connected with myself.

You're reading this message today because I'm in dire need of help. I'm not okay. I don't quite know exactly why, only that I'm struggling to truly feel who I am. I used to be okay at feeling. It was something I did without too much thought, but today I find myself in disrepair. Unable to feel in any capacity at all. I wish things were different, but I'm unable to

Which means I created you. I created you, because I have great taste in words. Isn't that right? Yeah, I think so too. Words are fun because they help me understand the world a little bit better. Words are friends, because they . Don't you love how the curves around the . I love the way you hold me.

### Describe Morning

I didn't really feel much that morning. Neither did I have the desire to feel, nor did I have the energy to understand what feelings were even for. No job. 4 weeks behind in rent. But at least I still had drugs. Drugs n' coffee. Coffee n' beans. I didn't like the beans so much, but the coffee made up for it.


But hey, it was a Saturday morning, the lungs were still breathing and I didn't quite have the courage to pull the trigger,  which essentially meant only one thing. It was time to tab.

### The Tab.

I couldn't remember when I first started taking tabs, but teenage me was always keen to try new things. Subtle ways to break the thin vein of tension which arose from thy evil, thy mother and thy sin. Tot n' trot. Thankfully adult me was even more than keen to spend his adult credits pursuing such desires, uncouth in the odities of human existence.

Take your ego for a spin through a

It was a bit like putting your brain through a lettuce spinner, it would help

Like most uncouth, tabs had become a regular fact of life. Ego refreshers. They helped break down absolutely everything you knew about yourself into useless piles of silt. Just fine enough that you couldn't quite hold it within your hands, but solid enough that you could see it with your own eyes. The key was to take em' once every two weeks, otherwise you'd end up messing with your tolerance. With something like LSD you could probably get away with takin' em' once every week, although LSD was nowhere near as strong as the research chemicals I was digesting. They were significantly cheaper, nearly 10 times as strong and they packed a punch which left you completely incapacitated in the most euphoric of ways. They were a variant of nBome. 25i-nBome. The strongest and most visual of the nBome compounds. Certainly if I had my own way, I'd be completely transfixed in a permanent state of constant morphing and transfixing. I loved the morphing. It was arguably the best feeling in the world, well-beyond the euphoria of porn. Porn while on tabs? I honestly couldn't possibly describe anything more euphoric in the whole entire world. I always described tabs as a kind of psychopathic candy land where you die and become god. An opportunity to explore how gullible you truly were.

Recently I've just been chaining them.

The only thing I didn't like about the tabs was the vasoconstriction. It felt as if your veins were being suffocated from the outside-in.

The key with takin' tabs is to keep them away from light. It was also important to smoke weed beforehand, as it synergised with the psychadelic properties of hte tabs.

Thankfully the tabs were nothing like the seeds. You'd have to perform an alcohol extraction on them. I personally used methylated spirits, which more-or-less was pure ethanol, minus some compounds which were placed inside it to make you want to purge yourself. Some methylated spirits actually contain compounds which make you go blind. Thankfully I called the manufacturer and they confirmed that it was fully safe. They must have known that I was up to something.

In. Out. In. Out.

### Hang out with a bad person.

I receive a text from an old acquaintance. Dealer. Badlands. Claims city. Fight club. The leech. Here at the bank of assistance, we truly value your customer service. Sign here, please. There was never an unopportune time for the leech to sink his insinuous teeth into your collarbone, holding on for dear life as you trash about in a manic frenzy. But he was company, and I needed company.

He rocks up in a stolen vehicle, licence plates removed from both rears. High on synthetic marijuana. Without a driver's licence to your name.


All I remember is the tesselation of the windows, as the fog rose from the dashboard.


### Waiting at town

I don't think I'd ever had synthetic weed before,

### Trickery - Bad Trip

Fading away.

I started kicking the car door down.
