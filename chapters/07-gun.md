### Wallet Monologue.

You stare at your wallet. Your wallet stares back. There's flashes of money but it's terribly lack. So you give it your lust. A sign of your love. An abundance of lithe and a home in your bust. For the loyalty of heart. For your new best friend. For a shuckle of mildew. In a chive of pretend. Yet your offering is paltry. Without charm. Without pride. As it lingers for a cure. A kick in it's stride. So you worship these notes. The validation of their crisp. Upon a smooth lilac surface. You suffer without a kiss. As you embrace its harsh judgement. Striking pickle n' fear. So as to be a better person. The one you call dear. It creeds. You blare. Our ceremony in dissociation. Amongst a decoration of colour and quantifiable misassociation. Fickle n' gold. The mystique of a millionaire. At a fraction of the lie, so your reality must bear. So now in your wallet. You notice nothing but jewel. Your wallet is lordship. The priest of your cruel. Tickle me lucky. Tickle me vain. The disdain of your linger. The savage of your pain. Curiously plith. Pity in its crumb. A venture of foam upon a lilith of numb. Devoid. Of. All. Culture.

### Describe Tampons / Milo

The weekly shop. Danger's Harper Quinn. I walk past a packet of tampons. The beauty aisle. A menstrual sensation enthralled in the candid exasperation of a desperate lowlife. A murky sign of affection. Nostalgia's golden trickle upon which dazzles the senses into a premium-grade dust. Reminding you of just how weak you truly are. I'd chew on em' if they didn't remind me so much of Milo. Her erratic touch. The boiled ingenuity of a misanthropic mind, washed against an afflictive sleaze of mindless inconsequence. I suppose I wanted to hold her. Embrace her. Call her nice things. Perhaps more than she herself wanted to be held or spoken to, as an ode to my own quixotic desires, now working against me in a defective ward of malevolent circumstance. Hospitalised. Desecrating the basis of my one true love. Locking her away in a blighted cage of impractical pursuits, never to be realised in any sort of modern interpretation again. Stupid sop. I think I should get chips. Should I get chips? I mean, have chips ever done anyone any harm? At least as far as I can tell, chips have been a fantastic contribution towards national GDP. Aside from fat people. I wouldn't fuck a fat person, but at least in buying a packet today, I'm effectively denying some huffer out there from partaking any further in this madness of self-abuse. Allow me to assist, fat whore. As I push aside some walking tub of lard to gain access to my precious potato. Aaaaaaand, I no longer felt like eating chips anymore. Silly me.

I walk past a young couple. They seem happy. Healthy. Despair. Reason to self-annihilate. I respond by plunging my hand into a bubbling vat of corrugated butter. Drowning my sorrows in the creamy goodness of a pasturised opulence. The ice cream in my hand melts, matching the temperature of my soul. I feel sick. Their laughter was svelte. Sleek. You could feel it in their presence. Maybe it was the feeling of co-existence itself. The apparition of gurn n' chunk, splitting together in a rolling cylinder of tempered aurelia. Yet how did I fit into all of this? Who would be my other half? Perhaps that young, desirable stewardess standing over there deciding on which brand of toilet paper she'd rather squirt, or was I destined to remained pauper in this perversion of public space? I continued to stew in my unending jealousy. Alternating between pudding and sadness.

I grasped at a forlorn packet of two-minute noodles, wishing instead that it was a girlfriend. Although I guess noodles offered a similar comfort. Twiddle n' warmth in it's deciduous long strands, as they curl around your tongue in a yellow melt of fine-grained perfection. Then I thought of Milo. Then my body sank. Caving into it's interior. De-pitted for all it was worth. My face became both truly petrified, yet ambivalent to the premise of life itself. Stark in it's seltzer. Inanimate in it's shapelessness. Reimagined in it's waucht quaff of satanic fear. I assured myself it was okay. Perhaps Milo would appear from behind the vast refrigeration of milk and other lactose-intolerant odities to tell me that everything was okay. With a smile thrown in for good measure. It didn't happen. But thank god the apple pie was on special. It would go well with the week-old cream in the fridge.

### Describe the store

I wasn't exactly sure why I came to the supermarket. "Maintain minimal function," reads a menacing teleprompter inside my head. HA. I decide to ignore it. Although peppy in my remarks, at the very least I hadn't lost my sarcasm. An American staple akin to pouring ketchup upon an improvised bed of al dente pasta. My stomach churned a little. Ultimately, it wouldn't have made much of a difference if I'd simply perished right here. Right now. In amongst the fresh produce of leeks and limes jeering at my soul. Encouraging a nearby stampede of avocados to steal, rape and pleasure, as I conveniently fade away in the soles of these overpriced shoes, to be permanently transfixed onto a tombstone made from soot n' bone. I needed to concentrate. Pronto.

With one hand on my narcissistic plea beat begrudgingly against the clap of my jaw, it was clear I needed an edge. A plastic edge with a plantain for violence. I clawed my way through the interior of the store, fighting my thoughts in a chasm of pre-harvested fear. Now left in the capable hands of consumerist advertising to guide me towards an ideal set of nutritional choices. My foot takes one step into what seems like a vernacular of aluminum cans and toasted boxes. Sheen upon the loneliness of these infirmary white aisles and their gloss of duclaire, radiating an unrelenting eleutheromania of UV into the cornea of my eye. Incinerating all bacteria amongst the cardboard cities of crackers n' blue pastries drifting in amongst the discount stickers begging for your boutique. I place my hand on a bag of coffee. Do I even drink coffee? Well, I do now. As I placed the item half-willingly into the cusp of my basket, now beginning to weigh me down.

Poultry. Meat. I needed meat. To be a real man holdin' a real pair o' hardy beans. A hunk o' skunk. Gnawin' through a steady chain of solid proteins, brash with a side o' neurasthenic glue to hold the fucker down n' squirm. I yank my basket forward in a jocular struggle, as a roasted chicken grabs me by the throat in an impetuous deathmatch to the end. Cutting into my wiring. Daring me to breathe. Insinuous in it's aromatic disparity of citrus and marmalade preserve. Gulag treats. Creamy pasta salad. The chef has declared himself bankrupt as my mouth concaves into an uncommunicative liquidation of tarty flare. Wham! Bam! Thank you ma'am. Tins of reconstituted tallow invite my arteries into a underground debutante gall of grease n' slut. Clog me, baby. Hold me n' fuck me into a co-op of shame. Privy me to a tomato mash of insatiable rage. Homoerotic in it's besotted miscare. Crunch. Crunch. Cunrhc. Forget the greens. The antioxidonts. N' pick up a bunch o' yellows n' chow n' gloat it down sideways, you fuckin' mutt. The gook chokes. Another beautiful entry into the fraught boredom now mottling your larynx, purchased and prepared with these hands of candour. Siphoning themselves through a network of stomaches even ol' Uncle John couldn't have known how to SCARE. Mac n' Cheese was fair game, and although I was unsure as to how I was going to haul several dozen boxes back to my front door, I at least made the effort to upgrade my hand carrier to a fully-fledged shopping cart. Mission accomplished, cunt.

### Describe the checkout

I proceed to the checkout. A greasy teenager in tight jeans greets me. Her camel toe snarls back. Grouched in a perinephritis of bad brie. Masticating under the pressure of an abusive father. Ulcerating in a moistened shrill of pubescent displeasure. My mouth dries like a Turkish prune. Her gunt glistens back. Reflecting upon the lacerated tiger stripes of her purple arms. Spaced-out like a fuckin' smurf. I certainly wouldn't have fucked her mother. That trailer trash causing my foreskin to malt in disgust. I swallow the regurgitated corn in the back of my throat. It quenches a nine. Her pudgy body was like gazing into a dysfunctional projector for the disfigured. Lips the size of banana trees. Her mulled hair, as thin as a deceased whore on the cusp of payday. It smelt of dried cum, and not the cute kind you find on young children. I grab an item from my shopping cart and I place it onto the conveyor belt. A feminist's nightmare. She passes me a dry look of contempt. Nice one, honey. As she barely lifts her lumpy arms in order to scan the on-coming onslaught of vague nutrition, which she wanted nothing more than to smother her thick face with n' call it fair play. Caught in a mind of cardboard, she stands there dreaming of throat-fucking a freshly-cut cantalope, straight from the hands of a rough industrialist. Nice n' dykie, as they say. Her camel toe loosens, as pieces of gunk fall out of her vagina and onto the floor below. What a glorious day to be alive in this half-wit therapy of mind-boggling dismay. I make sure she doesn't crush the two-minute noodles with her gargantuan lesbian hands. Fuck those hands. In noodles we trust.

## Scene 2 START

## Describe Mall.

Bright lights n' dazzlin' situations. The croon was neigh, and I was neither here. Nor there. Lost inside the slipstream of a fernlike observation. Slurpin' a 30 cent cup o' Calder Joe's. The inferior granulose of a flocculent bean, flung against the cold chill of a resplendent respirator. Grindin'. Scramble. Tweakin' coffee in the back o' my tongue. That fucker was a cancer waitin' to happen, whether I liked it or not. Croak. My neck picks up the regatta of a strong wind. I turn behind me. My silhouette follows. A thought captures my attention. I place my hand in my left pocket, searcching for a joint I rolled earlier in the AM. It was like tryin' a find a needle in a gaystack. The homophobia really ROCKS it. Who knows, maybe I'd receive one o' them free NASCAR-inspired blow-job if I continued the spontaneity. Boy, you could really taste the wet in this cup. Fuck off Calder Joe. I'm sick of your tasteless shit. The cup hits the bin and the drizzle fucks the floor. Sounds like a mall problem, so fuck off.

A child runs towards his mother, exasperating his lungs with a repetitive tune. That narcissistic cunt. Full of useless joy, as the young wizard bites into a Jackie Bar. Blurring his anemic body into a peripheral vision of wonky convolution. If I was man enough I'd walk over to him and snap his frail legs in two. Using em' as chopsticks for the fuckin' revolution. Watch out, folks. That Asian man over there has a degree. Burn em'. I stare down at the spangle of my shoes. Covered in a laceless kind of folly. Then I look up and all around me. The lights n' their embolden. The applaud of it's Proud Capitalism™. I suppose the mall truly was a man-made pleasure to be thrust at all times, at all hours of the day. Plaid in it's finicky pasta-like tendrils. Sloppin' fun across a smorgasboard of spendin' n' vacation for the whole family to employ. Need a fuckin' haircut? Well, our next available DILF will try he best, as he scrapes the semen from his asshole in an attempt to make you look swill. Tea shops. Sex shops. Chop shops. All kinds of roundish goods, designed to infiltrate n' swallow. The loamy scrunge begins it's cause. 2nd floor, and to your right. It's a bit like intercourse, without the encounter. Thank god for used condoms.

## A Gun shop.

As I walked my way through the lights, groceries in hand like a single-income mother with a penchant for refinanced cigarettes. I couldn't help but notice the misfit of teens, huddled together in a recreation of barrack mockery. Standing ironically outside a gun shop, with a look of innocence in their eyes. Ready for an orgy of cuddles, high-fructose corn syrup and bad memes. The pale chubby one was holding an oversized Pikachu. Probably as a substitute for her botched self-esteem, laid to rest by a life of unwanted negligence. I could picture it now. She was a future webcam model without the features of a model. The poor brook of a rogue varicose vein, smothered in a consortium of dark eyeliner and homebrand lasagne sauce. She would have fucked a child if she had to, in a smother of desperation even a palette of canned cellulose couldn't replicate. The heartfelt struggle of an incompetent teeny-bopper. If I were an adept pick-up artist I would have been able to swoop in and convinced her to exchange her hymen for a packet Pokémon trading cards, so she could post about it on her clandestine blog for the unadjusted. I suppose I didn't have the sense to put her out of her misery. No one wants to be raped by a flaccid cock, not even the saddest in society.

Soon the girl loses my attention. I mean, I'd already had a quick wank in the bathroom stall earlier and the weight of these groceries were killing me. Instead, a Remington Model 870 pump-action shotgun catches my eye in the window of the gun shop. Knowing the name of which made me feel incredibly smart, even though it was clearly printed on the window in decorative chalk marker. The Remington Model 870 pump-action shotgun was the kind of gun that wanted to be held. To be pointed into the forehead of another living being, in gratitude of their overwhelming patience, as you deliver a lethal buckshot in-between its concerned worried eyes. Cautious of the intense amount of leverage abiding in your quibble arms. A feeling only permitted during war time, as well as the occassional Federal shootout. Of course, truth was that I actually knew nothing about guns. I mean, what purpose could one have with a firearm? Perhaps it would make me cool. An irreversible punch. As a symbol of status. The ultimate dare against our largely unarmed population. I was intrigued. It felt like I was in an ol' Western in the middle of the Navada desert. Scout upon the rolling hills of Route 405, fit for a stranger with a glock n' a gall for danger. An attractive thematic construct to ponder. The perfect companion to my thoughts. I made my way to the store entrance, hinge upon an unviable level of sexualisation which would make it's way into my words, one way or another. The plast had begun.

## Inside Gun Shop

The chime of the shopkeeper's bell rattles my ears. It seems to persist for hours upon a metallic refraction of passionless retirement. Boring it's detriment into my skull. Reminding me that all my meaning and friendship in life had truly died.

Standing behind the counter was one of those brattish military types. Hair like a gay leopard, prowling over the shining attention-seeking objects obscuring her view. Her preference for men was obvious. Old n' rusty. Strewn in swathed snus. A paid tit-job n' a star-bangled tattoo accross her shaved asshole, as an oldie from down the road gobs into her douche and rides her into the trailer. Shoving his tongue deep n' wide as the thought of glory captures her mind. The natural talents of her mind. I imagine she was probably raped by a vertical segment of wildlife at a very young age. An ideological anarchist for the fans. An ideal career path for a former Hooter's model, knowledgable only in the arts of drugs n' marital assault.

"What can I do you for?", she lends, sly in the knock of her movement, as she leans in on the glass cabinet. Intent on eating me alive. She holds a knife, although I'm too preoccupied with her cleavage to notice the urgency of the situation.


The pink ponytails were cute.


You gun-totting fuck.


Now call me a soldier and hand me my award. My facial hair grazed against the undiluted air of the supermarket shelves. Disconfigured n' zany like a perfect princess. The wearer of this crown. My tongue grabs taste of my mouth. Glandular landform, my heinous. The saliva is not pretty.

## Shopkeeper


"I'm looking to purchase I gun."

"Obviously. What do you need it for?"

I hesitated slightly. I think she noticed.

"What looks cooler?"

I liked the idea of a revolver.

It feels heavy in my hand.


## Scene 3 END



I don't quite catch the reference.
