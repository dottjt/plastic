### Wallet Monologue.

You stare at your wallet. Your wallet stares back. There's money. But it's sick. Devoid of all culture. Ominously flick. Curiously plith. Pity in its crumb. A venture of foam upon a lilith of numb. So you give it your lust. A sign of your love. An abundance of lithe and a home in your crust. For the loyalty of heart. For your new best friend. For a shuckle of mildew. The chive of your pretend. Yet your offering is paltry. Without charm. Without pride. As it lingers for a cure. A kick in it's stride. So worship these notes. Validation in their crisp. Outline upon their lilac surface. Your suffer without a kiss. Embracing its judgement which strikes you with fear. So to be a better person who you call most near. It creeds. You blare. Ceremony in dissociation. Amongst the decorations of colour and quantity. Proving it's presence in fickle and gold. So now in your wallet. You notice nothing but pride. The mystique of a millionaire, at a fraction of the lie. Your wallet is lordship. The priest of your veins. Tickle me lucky. Tickle me vain. The disdain of this poor soul.

### Describe Tampons / Milo

The weekly shop. Danger's Harper Quinn. I walk past a packet of tampons. The beauty isle. A menstrual sensation enthralled in the candid exasperation of a desperate lowlife. A murky sign of affection. Nostalgia's golden trickle. Reminding you just how weak you truly are. I'd chew on em' if they didn't remind me so much of Milo. Her erratic touch. The boiled ingenuity of her misanthropic mind. Washed against an afflictive sleaze of mindless inconsequence. I suppose I simply wanted to hold her. Embrace her. Call her nice things. Perhaps more than she herself wanted to be held or spoken to. As an ode to my own quixotic desires, now working against me in a defective ward of malevolent circumstance. Hospitalised. Locking my one true love away in a blighted cage of impractical pursuits, never to be realised again. Stupid sop. I think I should get chips. Should I get chips? I mean, chips have never done anyone any harm. At least as far as I can tell. Aside from fat people. I wouldn't fuck a fat person, but at least I'm denying a real huffer from binging any further. Allow me to assist, fat whore. I no longer felt like eating chips.

I walk past a young couple. They seem happy. Healthy. Despair. Reason to suicide, as I plunge my hand into a vat of clarified butter. Drowning my sorrows in the creamy goodness of a pasturised opulence. Their laughter was svelte. Sleek. You could feel something in their presence. Maybe it was co-existence itself. Yet how did I fit into this situation? Where was my young other half? I continued to stew in jealousy. Alternating between pudding and sadness. I grasped at a packet of two-minute noodles, wishing instead that it was a girlfriend. I guess noodles offered a similar comfort. Twiddle warmth in it's delicious long strands. As they curl around your tongue in yellow melt of fine-grained perfection. Then I thought of Milo, causing my body to sink into it's interior. My face became both truly petrified, yet ambivalent to the premise of life itself. I didn't really know who I was in this moment. Arguably I didn't even care. All I wanted was a smile and for Milo to appear from behind the Milk refridgerators and tell me that everything was okay. Thank god the homebrand apple pie was on special.

### Describe the store

Although peppy with my remarks, I had no idea what I needed to maintain my minimal function. I would have been happy to simply perish in the soles of these shoes, to be permanently transferred away to a happier place where the heaviness in my heart could be free. I needed to concentrate. Shell-shocked and without care, I continued to my narcissistic plea inside the interior of the large department store, now left to the capable hands of consumerist advertising to guide me towards an ideal set of nutritional choices. I embarked into what seemed like a vernacular of aluminum cans and toasted boxes, I couldn't help but notice the loneliness of the infirmary white aisles. Radiating an unrelenting beam of UV into the cornea of my eye, incinerating all bacteria amongst the cardboard cities of crackers n' blue pastes drifting in amongst the discount stickers begging you boutique fallacy. I place my hand on a container of coffee. Do I even drink coffee? Well, I do now, as I placed it half-willingly into the hand basket weighing me down. Soiling my mood in gloom.

The aromatic disparity of the meekly roasted chickens grabs me and cuts into my wiring. This is what men swore. Creamy pasta salad. Thank you, sir. Tins of tins of tins. Reconstituted tallow. Clog me, baby. Thunder-fuck me in shame. Forget the greens. Antioxidonts. Mac n' Cheese was fair game, and although I was unsure as to how I was going to haul several dozen boxes of it home, I at least made the effort to upgrade my carrier to a fully-fledged shopping trolley.


### Describe the checkout

I proceed to the checkout. A teenager in tight jeans greets me. I wouldn't have even fucked her mother.

My birthday was coming up. It helped to be prepared.

## A Gun shop.

A gun shop. I'd never bought a gun before. I suppose there was no harm in



The chime of the shopkeeper's bell. Metallic refraction.



Standing behind the counter was a brattish  . The ideal career path for a former Hooter's model.

with pink ponytails.

"What can I do you for?"

"I'm looking to purchase I gun."

"Obviously. What do you need it for?"

I hesitated slightly. I think she noticed.

"What looks cooler?"

I liked the idea of a revolver.
