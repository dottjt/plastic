### Wallet Monologue.

You stare at your wallet. Your wallet stares back. There's flashes of money but it's terribly lack. So you give it your lust. A sign for your love. An abundance of lithe and a home in your crust. For the loyalty of heart. For your new best friend. For a shuckle of mildew. In a chive of pretend. Yet your offering is paltry. Without charm. Without pride. As it lingers for a cure. A kick in its stride. So you worship these notes. The validation of their crisp. Upon a smooth lilac surface. Your suffer for a kiss. As you embrace its harsh judgement. Striking pickle n' fear. So as to be a better person. The one you call dear. It creeds. You blare. Our ceremony in dissociation. Amongst a decoration of colour and quantifiable misassociation. Fickle n' gold. The mystique of a millionaire. At a fraction of the lie, so your reality must bear. So now in your wallet. You notice nothing but jewel. Your wallet is lordship. The priest of your cruel. Tickle me lucky. Tickle me vain. The disdain of your linger. The savage of your pain. Curiously plith. Pity in its crumb. A venture of foam upon a lilith of numb. Your heart is devoid of culture.

### Describe Tampons / Milo

The weekly shop. Danger's Harper Quinn. I walk past a packet of tampons. The beauty aisle. A menstrual sensation enthralled in the candid exasperation of a desperate lowlife. Murky is its sign of affection. Remnant of nostalgia's golden trickle upon which dazzles a premium-grade dust, reminding you of just how clutch you truly are. I'd chew one of em' right now if they didn't remind me so much of Milo. Her erratic touch. The boiled ingenuity of a misanthropic mind, now washed against the afflictive sleaze of a mindless triviality. I suppose I wanted to hold her. Embrace her. Call her nice things. Perhaps more than she herself wanted to be held or spoken to. In an ode to my own quixotic desires, now working against me in a defective ward of malevolent circumstance. Hospitalised. Inanity. Desecrate upon the basis of our one true love, as if to lock her away inside a blighted cage of impractical pursuits. Never to be realised again in this demolition of modernity. Stupid sop.

I think I should get chips. Should I get chips? I mean, have chips ever done me any harm? At least as far as I'm aware, chips have been a fantastic contribution towards National GDP. Well, except for fat people. And I mean, who wants to fuck a fat person? At least in buying this packet of chips, what I'm effectively doing is denying some huffer out there the opportunity to partake in the culnary equivalent of S&M. "Allow me to assist, fat whore." As I push aside some walking tub of lard who's become manic at the thought of using my precious potato as a fleshlight. Aaaaaaand, I no longer felt like eating chips anymore. Silly me.

I walk past a young couple. They seem happy. Healthy. Despair. Trapped in their own infalliable unreason. I respond to their success by plunging my hand into a bubbling vat of corrugated sherbet, drowning my sorrows in the creamy goodness of a pasturised opulence. Buttery grim. I trip on a shoelace. The ice cream tips n' slews down the exterior of my hand, matching the sultry temperature of my unearned scrutiny. Snapshot at the hip. I feel sick already. Svelte in the ambush of their jovial laughter. Deterred by all aspects of living. Satin. Maybe it was the feeling of co-existence itself, gluing to your flick in a capillary of munted clot. Slunk. That apparition of gurn n' chunk, skating down the crease in a rollin' cylinder of tempered tallow. Aurelia. Yet who was I? How did I fit into this scene, and who would be my other half? Perhaps I would have a shot at that young desirable stewardess standing over there by the toilet paper aisle, as we discussed which brand of towelette she prefered to succumb to the confectionery of her squirt. Consequently leading her to naughtily bite her finger in a playful sway, suggesting much more than would be reasonable in a mere supermarket jive. Perhaps I was simply destined to remained pauper in this perversion of public space, to be moistened by a senior with the clorox of a dishrag. I continued to stew in my unending jealousy, alternating between pudding and sadness. Lost in this moment amongst time. Harrowing for something cheaper.

I grasp at a cup of two-minute noodles from the international aisle, wishing instead that it was a mentally unstable girlfriend. Bulimic in her twine of shattered bulsa wood, forgiving in the pneumonia rotting her lungs. Although I suppose noodles offered a similar comfort to women, twiddle n' warmth in their long deciduous strands, as they curl around your tongue in a yellow melt of fine-grained perfection. Supple in its muddy kiss along the scent of one's throat, like a tender lover's liaison in the grand hotel of a five-star luxury suite. Then I thought of Milo. The curse of my inconsummate. The cure to my dread. Inanimate in its writhe shapelessness, as her absence beseeches my body to sink further into its interior. Alveolated for all its worth. Both petrified, yet ambivalent. To be reimagined in a waucht quaff of satanic fear, hurtling down the cavity of your neck with the hinderance of its revere. Stark in its astraphobia. Seltzer fantastisch. I assured myself that everything was okay. Perhaps Milo would appear from behind the vast refrigeration of milk to deliver me my care, with a smile thrown in for good measure. Of course, she simply never appeared. But thank god the apple pie was on special, because it now meant I had an excuse to eat the week-old cream in the fridge. Crisis averted.

### Describe the store

"Maintain minimal function," flashes the menacing teleprompter inside my head. HA. What a fool. Although peppy in my remark, it was evident I hadn't entirely lost my sarcasm; an American staple akin to pouring ketchup upon an impromptu bed of al dente mac n' cheese. The stomach churns. And yet, an anomaly appears from the corner of my eye. The discarded esthetic of a invalid coffee cup, presumably abandoned by a teenage mother on the prowl for some 50 cent diapers. How lovely. The sin is clear. Utterly ignoring my intuition for ordinal waste, I lunge towards the grunge. I geese. The cup is still warm. It soothes. I place my lips around the remaining smudge of lipstick left on the edge of its crumpled lid, pretending as if it were the dissolute of her scandalous mouth, pressed passionately against the wrong of my nose in a fantasy of unscrupulous romance. A bedlum of precum emerges from my pants. It soaks. I feel dirty. Alone. I want to cry. But I'm already surrounded by sadness. I scuttle.

Ultimately, it felt as if it wouldn't have made much of a difference if I'd simply perished. Right here. Right now. In amongst the fresh produce of leeks n' limes jeering at the jazz in my soul. Encouraging my trample upon a stampede of ripened avocados eager to steal, rape n' pleasure, as I conveniently fade away into the ashes of these overpriced shoes. Screaming in a sandy lethargy. Despondent. I needed to concentrate. Pronto. The teleprompter flashes again. "Oh, shut up," I shout into the cavity of an empty shelf. Crap. An older lady throws me an odd look before returning to her shopping trolley. Confused. I'd been caught. It was time to edge. Bounty. With a firm grip on my narcissistic plea, I curb. Swallow. My salivia beats begrudgingly against the clap of my jaw, initiating a subtle plantain for southern violence. I stomp my way through each aisle, fighting the presence of my thoughts in a chasm of pre-harvested fear. Conveniently left in the capable hands of consumerist advertising, as it guides me towards mother's ideal arbitration of nutritional affairs. The cramp is real. My fate is proceed.

Although I wasn't exactly sure why I came to the supermarket in the first place, it was neither the time nor place to be asking such gruel. All I knew was that I was king and that this was my jungle, ready to be ravaged in the disinterest of my assay. My foot takes one step into what seems like a vernacular of aluminum n' toast. Impaired upon an illusion of sheen ghostliness, parity to the loneliness of these infirmary white aisles and their gloss duclaire. As they radiate an unrelenting eleutheromania into the cornea of my eye, incinerating bacteria in amongst a cardboard city of blue n' neckwear. Drifting in amongst the discount stickers of countless ration, begging artfully for your glee n' boutique. The cautious is fair. The aisle is plenty.

I delegate my hand onto a canister of bastard coffee, placing its sublime tin into the temptation of my basket. Suffering under the ever-growing tenderness of my payload, as it weighs me down under its irresistable hunch of mud n' horse breath foundations. Tilting my stitch. Spilling time over into the gawp of my dietary pittance. Poultry. Meat. I needed meat. Hardy beans. A course of nails. So I could be a real man with a real pair, like some hunk o' skunk gone gnawin' through a steady chain of solid proteins; brash with a side o' neurasthenic glue to hold the fucker down. Squirm. We cherish. We square. I yank my basket forward in a jocular struggle immense proportion, as a roasted chicken confronts me. Grabbing me by the throat in an impetuous deathmatch to the end. Cutting my wiring with the rhapsody of a sex offender. Daring me to breathe under an aromatic disparity of citrus n' marmalade preserve, slashing against the skin in a molten reduction of saline. Insinuous Gulag. Creamy pasta slut. The chef has declared himself bankrupt, concaving my mouth into an uncommunicative liquidation of tarty flare. Wham! Bam! FUCK YOU TOO, SLICKER.

Tins of reconstituted tallow invite my arteries into a underground debutante gall of grease n' vulgarity. Clog me, baby. Hold me n' fuck me into a co-op of shame. Privy me to a tomato mash of insatiable rage. Homoerotic in it's besotted miscare. Crunch. Crunch. Cunrhc. Forget the greens. The antioxidonts. N' pick up a bunch o' yellows n' chow n' gloat it down sideways, you fuckin' mutt. The gook chokes. Another beautiful entry into the fraught boredom now mottling your larynx, purchased and prepared with these hands of candour. Siphoning themselves through a network of stomaches even ol' Uncle John couldn't have known how to SCARE. Mac n' Cheese was fair game, and although I was unsure as to how I was going to haul several dozen boxes back to my front door, I at least made the effort to upgrade my hand carrier to a fully-fledged shopping cart. Mission accomplished, cunt.

### Describe the checkout

I proceed to the checkout. A greasy teenager in tight jeans greets me. Her camel toe snarls back. Grouched in a perinephritis of bad brie. Masticating under the pressure of an abusive father. Ulcerating in a moistened shrill of pubescent displeasure. My mouth dries like a Turkish prune. Her gunt glistens back. Reflecting upon the lacerated tiger stripes of her purple arms. Spaced-out like a fuckin' smurf. I certainly wouldn't have fucked her mother. That trailer trash causing my foreskin to malt in disgust. I swallow the regurgitated corn in the back of my throat. It quenches a nine. Her pudgy body was like gazing into a dysfunctional projector for the disfigured. Lips the size of banana trees. Her mulled hair, as thin as a deceased whore on the cusp of payday. It smelt of dried cum, and not the cute kind you find on young children. I grab an item from my shopping cart and I place it onto the conveyor belt. A feminist's nightmare. She passes me a dry look of contempt. Nice one, honey. As she barely lifts her lumpy arms in order to scan the on-coming onslaught of vague nutrition, which she wanted nothing more than to smother her thick face with n' call it fair play. Caught in a mind of cardboard, she stands there dreaming of throat-fucking a freshly-cut cantalope, straight from the hands of a rough industrialist. Nice n' dykie, as they say. Her camel toe loosens, as pieces of gunk fall out of her vagina and onto the floor below. What a glorious day to be alive in this half-wit therapy of mind-boggling dismay. I make sure she doesn't crush the two-minute noodles with her gargantuan lesbian hands. Fuck those hands. In noodles we trust.

## Scene 2 START

### Describe Mall.

Bright lights n' dazzlin' situations. The croon was neigh, and I was neither here. Nor there. Lost inside the slipstream of a fernlike observation. Slurpin' a 30 cent cup o' Calder Joe's. The inferior granulose of a flocculent bean, flung against the cold chill of a resplendent respirator. Grindin'. Scramble. Tweakin' coffee in the back o' my tongue. That fucker was a cancer waitin' to happen, whether I liked it or not. Croak. My neck picks up the regatta of a strong wind. I turn behind me. My silhouette follows. A thought captures my attention. I place my hand in my left pocket, searcching for a joint I rolled earlier in the AM. It was like tryin' a find a needle in a gaystack. The homophobia really ROCKS it. Who knows, maybe I'd receive one o' them free NASCAR-inspired blow-job if I continued the spontaneity. Boy, you could really taste the wet in this cup. Fuck off Calder Joe. I'm sick of your tasteless shit. The cup hits the bin and the drizzle fucks the floor. Sounds like a mall problem, so fuck off.

A child runs towards his mother, exasperating his lungs with a repetitive tune. That narcissistic cunt. Full of useless joy, as the young wizard bites into a Jackie Bar. Blurring his anemic body into a peripheral vision of wonky convolution. If I was man enough I'd walk over to him and snap his frail legs in two. Using em' as chopsticks for the fuckin' revolution. Watch out, folks. That Asian man over there has a degree. Burn em'. I stare down at the spangle of my shoes. Covered in a laceless kind of folly. Then I look up and all around me. The lights n' their embolden. The applaud of it's Proud Capitalism™. I suppose the mall truly was a man-made pleasure to be thrust at all times, at all hours of the day. Plaid in it's finicky pasta-like tendrils. Sloppin' fun across a smorgasboard of spendin' n' vacation for the whole family to employ. Need a fuckin' haircut? Well, our next available DILF will try he best, as he scrapes the semen from his asshole in an attempt to make you look swill. Tea shops. Sex shops. Chop shops. All kinds of roundish goods, designed to infiltrate n' swallow. The loamy scrunge begins it's cause. 2nd floor, and to your right. It's a bit like intercourse, without the encounter. Thank god for used condoms.

### A Gun shop.

As I walked my way through the lights, groceries in hand like a single-income mother with a penchant for refinanced cigarettes. I couldn't help but notice the misfit of teens, huddled together in a recreation of barrack mockery. Standing ironically outside a gun shop, with a look of innocence in their eyes. Ready for an orgy of cuddles, high-fructose corn syrup and bad memes. The pale chubby one was holding an oversized Pikachu. Probably as a substitute for her botched self-esteem, laid to rest by a life of unwanted negligence. I could picture it now. She was a future webcam model without the features of a model. The poor brook of a rogue varicose vein, smothered in a consortium of dark eyeliner and homebrand lasagne sauce. She would have fucked a child if she had to, in a smother of desperation even a palette of canned cellulose couldn't replicate. The heartfelt struggle of an incompetent teeny-bopper. If I were an adept pick-up artist I would have been able to swoop in and convinced her to exchange her hymen for a packet Pokémon trading cards, so she could post about it on her clandestine blog for the unadjusted. I suppose I didn't have the sense to put her out of her misery. No one wants to be raped by a flaccid cock, not even the saddest in society.

Soon the girl loses my attention. I mean, I'd already had a quick wank in the bathroom stall earlier and the weight of these groceries were killing me. Instead, a Remington Model 870 pump-action shotgun catches my eye in the window of the gun shop. Knowing the name of which made me feel incredibly smart, even though it was clearly printed on the window in decorative chalk marker. The Remington Model 870 pump-action shotgun was the kind of gun that wanted to be held. To be pointed into the forehead of another living being, in gratitude of their overwhelming patience, as you deliver a lethal buckshot in-between its concerned worried eyes. Cautious of the intense amount of leverage abiding in your quibble arms. A feeling only permitted during war time, as well as the occassional Federal shootout. Of course, truth was that I actually knew nothing about guns. I mean, what purpose could one have with a firearm? Perhaps it would make me cool. An irreversible punch. As a symbol of status. The ultimate dare against our largely unarmed population. I was intrigued. It felt like I was in an ol' Western in the middle of the Navada desert. Scout upon the rolling hills of Route 405, fit for a stranger with a glock n' a gall for danger. An attractive thematic construct to ponder. The perfect companion to my thoughts. I made my way to the store entrance, hinge upon an unviable level of sexualisation which would make it's way into my words, one way or another. The plast had begun.

### Inside Gun Shop

The chime of the shopkeeper's bell rattles in my ears, persisting for hours upon the metallic refraction of its passionless retreat. Boring its detriment into my skull. Reminding me that all my meaning and friendship in life had truly died.

Standing behind the counter was one of those brattish military types. Hair like a gay leopard, prowling over the shining attention-seeking objects obscuring her view. Her preference for men was obvious. Old n' rusty. Strewn in swathed snus. A paid tit-job n' a star-bangled tattoo accross her shaved asshole, as an oldie from down the road gobs into her douche and rides her into the trailer. Shoving his tongue deep n' wide as the thought of glory captures her mind. The natural talents of her mind. I imagine she was probably raped by a vertical segment of wildlife at a very young age. An ideological anarchist for the fans. An ideal career path for a former Hooter's model, knowledgable only in the arts of drugs n' marital assault.

"What can I do you for?", she lends, sly in the knock of her movement, as she leans in on the glass cabinet. Intent on eating me alive. She holds a knife, although I'm too preoccupied with her cleavage to notice the urgency of the situation.


The pink ponytails were cute.


You gun-totting fuck.


Now call me a soldier and hand me my award. My facial hair grazed against the undiluted air of the supermarket shelves. Disconfigured n' zany like a perfect princess. The wearer of this crown. My tongue grabs taste of my mouth. Glandular landform, my heinous. The saliva is not pretty.


I don't quite catch the reference.


### Shopkeeper


"I'm looking to purchase I gun."

"Obviously. What do you need it for?"

I hesitated slightly. I think she noticed.

"What looks cooler?"

I liked the idea of a revolver.

It feels heavy in my hand.

S&W Model 29 in .44 magnum

.38 caliber Smith & Wesson Model 10

It would have been cool to have holstered my gun inside the mall.
