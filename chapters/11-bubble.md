### Openning Monologue

It was any ordinary day. The sun continued it's glorious expansion into our extinction. The trees basked in the overflowing radiation sustaining their very creation. Children across the middle east strapped themselves to vests of high-impact explosives in faithful martyr of their magical prophet, while the U.S. remained ever-more ignorant of the internal politics of foreign occupation. "Fight a war, in a war," announces a young marshall kit in immaculate serviceman attire, as he paced the outskirts of a halal-certified brothel south of the Kuwait border. Crippled in fear and brooding anxiety, the NFL draft hopeful of 98' was plagued by the contrived fantasies of rape and lore he wished to impose upon these working-class women, driven by the bloody battle he fought against their now-dead husbands. With a gun in one hand and a thoughtless desire to seek pre-emptive revenge, the young man storms the building and pins down a screaming young woman, plunging his battle-hardened penis through her torn burka and inside her aching petit figure. Ripping through the tight walls of her vagina as her mouth pulpitates in a gazeless stare of trauma, her body now flaccid in a feint tremor of incomprehension. In a mute trance of  inarticulate shock, the man climaxes inside her in an explosion of cum, before kissing her on her pale lips to help her forget the pain.

"That was quite overt," I thought to myself, as I took a moment to pause and think about the fundamental implications of my imagination, backdrop against a dyslexic array of human dwellings littering the zeitgeist of my train ride into work that particular morning. "...and as we enter our pods, secure in a tunnel-vision of pre-determined repetition, it's important that we remember to gloat at the shit-giggler. He is our only hope." I knew I should have stopped writing year's ago, my mind abuzz with all sorts of fantastical whims and jarring phrases, designed to fright and excite, like a pickled jar of boiled cantaloupe.

Dangled in a mop of disarray, my hair found itself in desperate need of attention. Part of me liked the slight emo gradle, constituent to my overall look as a crazed loner with a knack for competitive fighters and an infatuation for Japanese animated breasts. Oh, another day, another dawn. Rest our souls in the flashy marginalisation of peace, fervour and extreme exuberance. Then in a rush of temporal ammonia, I transferred my mind over to the hands of late-night regret, as I stepped off the train and onto the newly-renovated platform, into a compound of career psychopaths and keyboard warriors. Atop of a vending machine stood a lone gunman, armed with a toothpick and a bucket of cum, ready to drown solace in it's rightful place on the floor of an over-worked McDonalds where he got paid a meagre salary and an inoffensive staff discount on all meals after 6pm.

### Describe Stock Market Crash

Truth is that today was hardly ordinary. The population, although stuck in their old ways of routine and procedure, were worried. You could see it in their compounding reluctance for direct eye-contact, in their remarkably ambivalent coffee choices, weighing borderline on the spectrum. Citizens and scoundrel alike were glued to their phones, attached to the digital ink streaming across their screams in a fiery cliff of red. The stock market had crashed and everyone was afraid. Jittery in a hive mind of ignorance and fear, collective in the increased alcohol consumption which seemingly struck the city almost overnight. Even the homeless were afraid, counting down their last remaining scraps and half-opened tin cans, rusted in the over-evaluation which had finally caught up to the people.

### Arriving at Office

There was a keen sense of dread that lingered in the never-ending stream of countless cogs that marched into the office building that morning, one foot in front of the other, conspiring itself in a feared battle-royale of blame and conjecture. Dark clouds in legions of three, gathered around the erroneous failures making themselves evident in the financial consequences thrust upon all. Peering into the sauntering graveyard of demotion and indemnity it holds sacred upon the walking bone and flesh. I shuddered as I stepped into the cold laborious lobby, shriek with the lost souls that levitated in a disturbed tremor to their casks awaiting them at their desks.

Turning my attention towards the usual happy-hour of moment, I smile and wave at the receptionist, only to receive a stark glare of putrid bitterness, as if I'd intentionally shot her cat in a feud of pure injustice. Gone were the vibrant colours and the buoyant pick-me-ups, and in were the bleak browns and sickening white cardigans, matched against an ice-cold corpse of Carbon lipstick and burnt silicone. It's as if she were preparing to give a lap dance at a funeral. Junior developers pacing back and forth in between their workstations, coddled in an anxiety of austere Bluetooth mouth and technological hysteria. Marketing co-ordinators and copywriters, in the dozens, tying nooses and makeshift scythes out of rejected board-meeting catch phrases, plain in the throughfare of dismal hype lending itself to this very disaster. Lowly interns grabbing imaginary cups of coffee from imaginary vendors, terrified in a role play of psychological truce.

### Milo Interaction

The only person who didn't quite seem so dejected was

"Hello stranger. Looks like someone decided to rock up to work today. I didn't know you liked me that much."

I wanted to cry.

"Sure."

"A candy confectionary company for human pets", states the first h1 element of our serverless website, hand-crafted in pure HTML by some orange-back.

"What's up with everyone? It seems a bit tense out there. You didn't attack some poor girl in the toilets again, did you?"

"Oh, you know me. I would never allow a witness escape. No, didn't you hear about the stock market? It's pretty brutal."

Yet something had caught her by surprise. Shock. Horror. Delore. In the fade distance, chirping in a distinctive waddle of daphnia and jellied sand, was a man the office had witnessed in months. Dressed casual in a Tahitian blind, peppered to the brim in tropical flowers and exotic motifs. It was a bit like watching an air travel billboard approach you without warning, alas to everyone's surprise. The boss was in the office for the first time in months. The chastity had become agonising. God had arrived.

### In work we trust

"In work we trust," preaches an overly-caffeinated woman sitting on-top of a repurposed milk crate, lactating uncontrollably through the red and white stripes of her luminous blouse. Veins firmly attached to the outer-rims of the patriarchy's pyrex mesh of pampered silence. "It's called leverage, silly", she claims in a jolly burst of hysteric miasma, as she points her finger towards the sky with a know-it-all grin. Mid-podcast, she turns her attention towards her computer screen, avidly licking her lips in an orgasmic laughter of despair, as she sensually contorts the crippling RSI in her hands, eyes caught in a casual dally with the company's Kanban Board of Innovation. Featuring an extensive spreadsheet of her most favourable physical attributes, it was the perfect checklist for the aspiring career-focused woman. Bloated Lips. Check. Fake Detachable Eyelashes. Check. Inflatable Silicone Breasts. Check. Bleached Pink Vagina? Still stuck in the Todo column, I see?

Ah well, that's a real shame and it might even cost her this year's promotion, however it's supple hastings here on the Mystery Mysogony Hour, as we invite everyone's favourite project manager to instigate this awful discrepancy. Well, it's official folks. The reports are in and unfortunately she's been an utter cunt of a "filthy bitch whore", prompting our beloved senior jockey to knock her out with his laptop stand and grope her massive breasts gushing with milky coalesce. He will then proceed to drag her limp body into a secure meeting room to be disfigured and raped, in swift preparation for an unidentifiable plethora of executive cock and caviar-littered cum. Involving at least half the sales floor and a freshly-picked intern trained purely in the art of gymnastic, it looks like we could be in for a real doozy, folks!

Men and children alike grab sections of her bruised body as it's dragged by in harmonious ceremony. "Take this poor women and guide her towards the top of patriarchy!", gleams an autistic man in an over-sized company sweater, gaff in a choking fit of insoluable lubricant following a sincere attempt to deep-throat a hard-drive full of high-resolution images of the CEO's junk. Unfortunately, it just ain't the same for ol' dick-weed here, what with his pronounced adam's apple and crippling inability to imitate a Disney-inspired blow-job. Fortunately however, eligible for his underage daughter who's just returned from rehab, proudly completing her 3rd stint in an all-inclusive five-star resort for anorexic over-achievers, following an unfortunate incident with a c-level executive and their new 'back-door' policy. Although I must admit, there's nothing quite like a carpal tunnel induced hand-job at three-to-ten in the afternoon, following an hour-long lecture on the cautionary reprimand of sexual harassment within the workplace. The status quo was here to stay.

### Describe Boss

"Well, well. If it isn't the shit-meister," gloats the 6-foot mirage of coconut-butter and Machiavellian breath, amok in an eschew of Pi√±a colada inspired hand signals. While he certainly wasn't the prettiest man, what with the raw gizzard and touching cellulite which dribbled from his chin, there was a lot to say about the sigh of comic relief which was his contribution towards the company. A title wedged so high on a pedestal so far away in the heavens above, that not even his own arrogance could pertain to the barrage of sanity attempting to bring him back down from such dizzying heights. He was the dad that allowed you to set mummy's new curtains on fire, if only so you'd shut up and bless him another 10 minutes of silence to watch the game in peace.

"What wonderful eyes you have, sir. It really is a delight to have you back in the office."

"Shut up, pansy. Now listen here kids. I've got some big news for you all, and you ain't gonna like it. This place is fallin' to shit and we're going to have to make some changes around ere'." Although everyone was seemingly aware of the financial strife that the company was going through, it was still business as usual round these parts of town. Largely, people lounged around and dwadled on their screens, sending each other memes and . At one point I'm pretty sure I even saw someone enstated a cardboard cutout.


### Pulled into the bosses' office

The room was so small you'd thought you were inside a miniature doll-sized simulation.



### Post Getting Fired.
