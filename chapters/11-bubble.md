## Scene 1 START

### Opening Monologue

It was any ordinary day. The sun continued it's glorious expansion into our extinction, and it's trees basked in the overflowing radiation emanating from the sky. Seemingly weary of it's sudden encounter with consciousness. Providing light to all of the world, inspiring children across the middle east to strap themselves with high-impact explosives in faithful martyr of their magical prophet. The creator of sun. The harbinger of hymn. While the rest of the world remained ever-more ignorant of the internal politics of foreign occupation. End scene.

"Fight a war, win a war," announces a young U.S. Marshall in immaculate serviceman attire, as he paces the outskirts of a halal-certified brothel south of the Kuwait border. The fear was real in his mind; the mind of this 98' NFL draft hopeful. Plagued by the contrived fantasies of rape and gore he wished to impose upon these working-class women; driven mad by the blood he drew from their now-deceased husbands, as they basked in the sand of Allah's praise. Covered in bullets of Christian descent. With a gun in one hand and a bible in the other, the professional soldier storms into the building with a loud BANG. Pinning down a young woman. Screaming. Plunging his battle-hardened penis into her petit figure, biting and tearing her burka in two. Ripping through the tight walls of her weakened vagina in a devouring ache, as her mouth proceeded to pulpitate in a gazeless stare of trauma. The soft outline of her body, now flaccid in a faint tremor of unquestionable incomprehension. Utterly mute in a trance of inarticulate shock. The man smothers his bible over her face. Suffocating her. Addressing her sin. Before climaxing inside her stricken body in an explosion of cum. Kissing her on her pale lips in a bid to help her forget the pain. Ending her misery with a glock to the brain.

### Back on the Train

"That was quite overt," I thought to myself. As I took a moment to pause and think about the fundamental implications of my imagination. Backdrop against a dyslexic array of miniature-sized dwellings, littering the zeitgeist of my train ride into work this particular morning. "...aaaand as we enter our pods, secure in a tunnel-vision of pre-determined repetition. It's super important that we remember to gloat at the shit-giggler over in the corner there. That coveted man promised to be our only hope. So don't forget to gloat!" I knew I should have stopped writing year's ago. My mind, abuzz with all sorts of fantastical whims and jarring phrases. Designed to fright and excite, like a pickled jar of boiled cantaloupe. Pour me, baby. Oh dear. And my hair truly was a mess. Dangled in a mop of disarray. In desperate need of style and attention. Although part of me liked the emo gradle, constituent to my overall look as a disenfranchised loner with a infatuation for Japanese animated breasts. Another day, another dawn. Rest our souls in this flashy marginalisation of peace, fervour to the extreme exuberance which rolls from your eyes. Then in an ecstatic rush of temporal ammonia, I transferred my mind over to the hands of a tired late-night regret. Stepping off the train and onto the newly-renovated platform, into a compound enclosure of career psychopaths and keyboard warriors. As a lone gunman stood on top of a vending machine, armed with a toothpick and a salience of rum, ready to drown solace in it's rightful place on the over-worked floor of a shopping-mall McDonalds. Where he got paid a meagre salary and an inoffensive staff discount for all meals after 6pm. How dame.

### Describe Stock Market Crash

Truth was that today was hardly ordinary. Although stuck in their ordinary ways, the population had descended into a castellation of worry. An unending cascade of hyperbolic discernment, in consequence of the scorched. You could see it in their reluctance. In their aversion for eye-contact. In their remarkably ambivalent choice of sub-station coffee, weighing borderline on a spectrum of dastardly unhuman. Citizens and scoundrel alike. Standing mesmerised at their phones. Glued to their screens inn a stream of digital ink, leering across their faces in a fiery cliff of red. The stock market had crashed and everyone was afraid. Collective in their hive mind of jitter and fear. Mindless in their consumption of pre-teen alcohol. An anguish of booze and silvery goon. Even the homeless were in an abundance of maul. Soaked weary in their bedraggled cardboard huts and sooty tin sheds, as they counted down their last remaining scraps and half-opened munitions, to the trail of a picant restlessness. The source of their drove. Perhaps I was beginning to lose my mind. I continued my tread along the rows towards my battlestation. A few blocks down from the epicentre. The house of wires. A touch of Brunei. Hollow in the presentiment that was sure to come.

### Arriving at Office

From the station to my stride, there was a keen sense of dread that lingered over the never-ending deja vu of countless cogs, marching in pairs of two into the office building that morning. As their forward-mass steadied into an unapproachable glide, forcing their feet into a cargo of motion. One foot in front of the other. Conspiring towards a messy battle-royale of blame and conjecture. Inconspicuously gathered around the erroneous failures of a hierarchical few, making itself evident in the financial consequences of a deep grim. Emanating from the crust in their paychecks. Thrust upon all. It was like peering into the sauntered graveyard of a demotional pew. Dark in it's legionarius clouds. Glory in it's indemnity. Held sacred upon millennia of bone and flesh, as I stepped into the overwhelming coldness of the laborious lobby. Shuddered in an eager impudence. In search for a quality of being. Shriek amongst the lost souls that levitated in a disturbed tremor, awaiting their burial at the core of their desks.

I throw a smile at the receptionist. The usual happy-hour of the moment. She returns my request with a stark glare. Putrid in it's bitterness. Montane in it's ochlophobia. As if I'd just maimed her cat with a thin piece of chicken wire and dumped it's sopping corpse in front of her. Gone were the vibrant colours and buoyant pick-me-ups. Those things which made her beam. Instead, I was presented with an emetology of bleak browns, matched against an ice-cold formosus of Carbon lipstick and burnt hand sanitiser.

sickening whites


It's as if she were preparing to give a lap dance at a funeral. Junior developers pacing back and forth in between their workstations, coddled in an anxiety of austere Bluetooth mouth and technological hysteria. Marketing co-ordinators and copywriters, in the dozens, tying nooses and makeshift scythes out of rejected board-meeting catch phrases, plain in the throughfare of dismal hype lending itself to this very disaster. Lowly interns grabbing imaginary cups of coffee from imaginary vendors, terrified in a role play of psychological truce.

### Milo Interaction

The only person who didn't quite seem so dejected was

"Hello stranger. Looks like someone decided to rock up to work today. I didn't know you liked me that much."

I wanted to cry.

"Sure."

"A candy confectionary company for human pets", states the first h1 element of our serverless website, hand-crafted in pure HTML by some orange-back.

"What's up with everyone? It seems a bit tense out there. You didn't attack some poor girl in the toilets again, did you?"

"Oh, you know me. I would never allow a witness escape. No, didn't you hear about the stock market? It's pretty brutal."

Yet something had caught her by surprise. Shock. Horror. Delore. In the fade distance, chirping in a distinctive waddle of daphnia and jellied sand, was a man the office had witnessed in months. Dressed casual in a Tahitian blind, peppered to the brim in tropical flowers and exotic motifs. It was a bit like watching an air travel billboard approach you without warning, alas to everyone's surprise. The boss was in the office for the first time in months. The chastity had become agonising. God had arrived.

### In work we trust

"In work we trust," preaches an overly-caffeinated woman sitting on-top of a repurposed milk crate, lactating uncontrollably through the red and white stripes of her luminous blouse. Veins firmly attached to the outer-rims of the patriarchy's pyrex mesh of pampered silence. "It's called leverage, silly", she claims in a jolly burst of hysteric miasma, as she points her finger towards the sky with a know-it-all grin. Mid-podcast, she turns her attention towards her computer screen, avidly licking her lips in an orgasmic laughter of despair, as she sensually contorts the crippling RSI in her hands, eyes caught in a casual dally with the company's Kanban Board of Innovation. Featuring an extensive spreadsheet of her most favourable physical attributes, it was the perfect checklist for the aspiring career-focused woman. Bloated Lips. Check. Fake Detachable Eyelashes. Check. Inflatable Silicone Breasts. Check. Bleached Pink Vagina? Still stuck in the Todo column, I see?

Ah well, that's a real shame and it might even cost her this year's promotion, however it's supple hastings here on the Mystery Mysogony Hour, as we invite everyone's favourite project manager to instigate this awful discrepancy. Well, it's official folks. The reports are in and unfortunately she's been an utter cunt of a "filthy bitch whore", prompting our beloved senior jockey to knock her out with his laptop stand and grope her massive breasts gushing with milky coalesce. He will then proceed to drag her limp body into a secure meeting room to be disfigured and raped, in swift preparation for an unidentifiable plethora of executive cock and caviar-littered cum. Involving at least half the sales floor and a freshly-picked intern trained purely in the art of gymnastic, it looks like we could be in for a real doozy, folks!

Men and children alike grab sections of her bruised body as it's dragged by in harmonious ceremony. "Take this poor women and guide her towards the top of patriarchy!", gleams an autistic man in an over-sized company sweater, gaff in a choking fit of insoluable lubricant following a sincere attempt to deep-throat a hard-drive full of high-resolution images of the CEO's junk. Unfortunately, it just ain't the same for ol' dick-weed here, what with his pronounced adam's apple and crippling inability to imitate a Disney-inspired blow-job. Fortunately however, eligible for his underage daughter who's just returned from rehab, proudly completing her 3rd stint in an all-inclusive five-star resort for anorexic over-achievers, following an unfortunate incident with a c-level executive and their new 'back-door' policy. Although I must admit, there's nothing quite like a carpal tunnel induced hand-job at three-to-ten in the afternoon, following an hour-long lecture on the cautionary reprimand of sexual harassment within the workplace. The status quo was here to stay.

### Describe Boss

"Well, well. If it isn't the shit-meister," gloats the 6-foot mirage of coconut-butter and Machiavellian breath, amok in an eschew of Piña colada inspired hand signals. While he certainly wasn't the prettiest man, what with the raw gizzard and touching cellulite which dribbled from his chin, there was a lot to say about the sigh of comic relief which was his contribution towards the company. A title wedged so high on a pedestal so far away in the heavens above, that not even his own arrogance could pertain to the barrage of sanity attempting to bring him back down from such dizzying heights. He was the dad that allowed you to set mummy's new curtains on fire, if only so you'd shut up and bless him another 10 minutes of silence to watch the game in peace.

"What wonderful eyes you have, sir. It really is a delight to have you back in the office."

"Shut up, pansy. Now listen here kids. I've got some big news for you all, and you ain't gonna like it. This place is fallin' to shit and we're going to have to make some changes around ere'." Although everyone was seemingly aware of the financial strife that the company was going through, it was still business as usual round these parts of town. Largely, people lounged around and dwadled on their screens, sending each other memes and . At one point I'm pretty sure I even saw someone enstated a cardboard cutout.


### Pulled into the bosses' office

The room was so small you'd thought you were inside a miniature doll-sized simulation.



### Post Getting Fired.
