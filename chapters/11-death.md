### Help Monologue

Hi. Have we met before? Probably not. Although it's really nice to meet you! Oh, and I really like your hair! I think it's a-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y fantastic! Seriously. You look stunning. Gorgeous. Not quite Brad Pitt gorgeous, but if that ain't pre-cum, then I don't know what is. Sorry if that came across as being a bit, uh, strong. We're still cool, right? Buddy. Buddy-o. Oh, and thank you! You're super kind, and I think you're cool too. We should be suede pals. Sticky fodder. Beatnik puppies. The kind of soup that warms you up n' keeps you placid. Content. I think we're going to get along just fine. Just. Fine.

I suppose you're reading this message today because I need help. You see, I'm not okay. Which is weird. Because I'm not dying or anything. I can still string these jolly ol' words together n' make a complete fool of myself on the internet. But that's not the point. The point is that everything sucks. It just sucks. Hell, even thinking about it just sucks. It's like everything is just a thousand times harder than it should be, and I couldn't possibly understand why. Fuck. Why am I so fucked? Why can't I just be fucking normal!? Would it be so hard just to unfuck myself for the next 10 minutes, so I can grab something to eat and just shut the fuck up!? I withdrew myself from my keyboard. Clearly it wasn't working.

### Describe Feelings

I didn't really feel much that morning, nor did I have the energy to understand how one should feel at all. At the very least, I knew I was sad. Alone. Desperate in my palpable need of attention, crippled by a failed relationship with the only person I ever cared about. A thought which had infected my mind in its crushing refusal to leave. Then there was the redundancy, which had dried my pockets to a pale crisp. I hadn't paid my rent in over a month, and my anxiety was beginning to manifest into the seething anger which would then dissipate into a spate of helplessness. Carried by the joints of marijuana which helped soften the blow of my own accommodative homicide. Lest I disintegrate into the torpid equivalent of a powdered cheddar; luxury as time begets.

### Describe Plans

Rejection after rejection, my inbox piled high with the unknown words of misfortunate recruiters. Impotent in their remarks of automated passion; steady in its stream of diffuse hope. Tangible only in its crisp retina font. Beckon to the lens of an idiot's eye. Almost nothing had gone to plan, as the decay progressed from my body to my mind. But hey, buck-aroo. It was still a Saturday. My lungs were still partially functioning from the . There was still at least a viable privation that I would continue to function until lunch, where I would enjoy a fictional sourdough. Relish with the chutney of a vineyard Ch√¢teau. In reality, I planned to get obscenely high, for Saturday was tab day. My favourite day of the week. Although recently both Monday and Tuesday, and Wednesday, and Friday had also become tab day. So really, was it even tab day at all? Not to mention, I was

. And I was looking as dangerous as ever in my cold-war stubble fit suitably for a Russian paratrooper.

### Describe Drugs

I stumbled my way into the study, pretending to be unseen.

. Sitting at my desk with the gift Milo had imparted with me on my birthday. An entire ten-rack of acid; hint with the altruistic policy of a

I couldn't remember when I first started taking tabs, but I suppose it was no different to when I started masturbating or hating my mother. All I knew is that they had become a regular fact of life; a cherish without the joy. I personally like to think of them as synonymous equalisers. A bit like washing lettice with a salad spinner. Clean n' squeaky.


LSD was a Psychopath's playground.


I held the .




Certainly if I had my own way, I'd be completely transfixed in a permanent state of constant morphing and transfixing. I loved the morphing. It was arguably the best feeling in the world, well-beyond the euphoria of porn. Porn while on tabs? I honestly couldn't possibly describe anything more euphoric in the whole entire world. I always described tabs as a kind of psychopathic candy land where you die and become god. An opportunity to explore how gullible you truly were.




The only thing I didn't like about the tabs was the vasoconstriction. It felt as if your veins were being suffocated from the outside-in.

The key with takin' tabs is to keep them away from light. It was also important to smoke weed beforehand, as it synergised with the psychadelic properties of hte tabs.

### Hang out with a bad person.

I receive a text from an old acquaintance. Dealer. Badlands. Claims city. Fight club. The leech. Here at the bank of assistance, we truly value your customer service. Sign here, please. There was never an unopportune time for the leech to sink his insinuous teeth into your collarbone, holding on for dear life as you trash about in a manic frenzy. But he was company, and I needed company.

He rocks up in a stolen vehicle, licence plates removed from both rears. High on synthetic marijuana. Without a driver's licence to your name.


All I remember is the tesselation of the windows, as the fog rose from the dashboard.


### Describe The Wait

In. Out. In. Out.

Hoping to disperse its lovely little claws into your spread, violating what little aspiration you have to weed your way back to safety. At first it shrieks in a mad outburst, indicating its own displeasure with the world. Then it withers into a cloud of mould to suffocate any amount of apprehension from gaining necessary foothold. Lastly it smothers in absolute quantity, absorbing scar tissue and trauma at an incomprehensible rate. And once it's all over, in the snap of a heartbeat, it was as if nothing remained at all. A desolate fire of dementia, swept clean in an enticing devastation of brilliance.
