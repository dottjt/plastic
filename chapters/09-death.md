<!-- Sadness monologue -->

Hi. Have we met before? I know we probably haven't met before, but it's really nice to meet you. I like your hair. I think it's pretty. I definitely think we're going to get along. I'm probably sounding cheesy, but I feel that you're not quite like the others. You have a really beautiful smile and I really like the way your eyes blink. I think it's classy. Oh, and I promise not to sexualise you. As of this very moment, I've decided to take the time to write to you. To admire you. To bring you to life. Really, I spend most of my free time writing, and it's something I really enjoy doing. Hopefully enough to inspire others to write, although I'm not sure if that's such a good idea. You might even call me a writer, not that I do it for a living. It's just something that helps me feel a little more ...connected with myself.

You're reading this message today because I'm in dire need of help. I am not okay. I don't quite know exactly why, only that I'm struggling to truly feel who I am. I used to be okay at feeling. It was something I did without too much thought, but today I find myself in disrepair. Unable to feel in any capacity at all. I wish things were different, but I'm unable to

I didn't really feel much that morning. Neither did I have the desire to feel, nor did I .

But hey, it was a Saturday morning, the lungs were still breathing and I didn't quite have the courage to pull the trigger,  which essentially meant only one thing. It was tab time.

<!-- Describe the tabs, and the relationship with drugs. -->

Like most uncouth civilians, tabs had become a regular fact of life. Although they had become routine at this point, I always liked to think of them as ego refreshers. They helped break down absolutely everything you knew about yourself into useless piles of silt. Just fine enough that you couldn't quite hold it within your hands, but solid enough that you could see it with your own eyes. The key was to take em' once every two weeks, otherwise you'd end up messing with your tolerance. With something like LSD you could probably get away with takin' em' once every week, although LSD was nowhere near as strong as the research chemicals I was digesting. They were significantly cheaper, nearly 10 times as strong and they packed a punch which left you completely incapacitated in the most euphoric of ways. Certainly if I had my own way, I'd be completely transfixed in a permanent state of constant morphing and transfixing. I always described it as a kind of psychopathic candy land where you die and become god. An opportunity to explore how malleable you truly really were.

 and if I had my way, I'd probably . I could only afford the cheap tabs where were basically a variant of research chemical which purported to

What I loved most about tabs was the way it made you feel. I loved the morphing.


The key with takin' tabs is to keep them away from light.




 Which means I created you. I created you, because I have great taste in words. Isn't that right? Yeah, I think so too. Words are fun because they help me understand the world a little bit better. Words are friends, because they

I don't think you're not like the others.


 I'm a writer. I have great taste in words. It is something I like to do, all the time. Words. The H truly is a beautiful letter.


In. Out. In. Out.

I receive a text from an old friend. A dealer. Yeah, what the fuck.

He rocks up in a

Sometimes, it feels like I'm granted permission to be an awful person. Like I'm allowed to be so absolutely consumed in hatred that I don't even know who I am anymore.
