### Describe Taxi Ride

One and three. 1 and 3. Left. Right. Tip. Tap. Winky fuckin' driver. The drink is casually racist. Soy boy sits with a Sudofed window shake. Red Raccoon crave; lavish lurch fringe. Two and four. 2 and 4. Steamroll grief machine. Even numbers by my side. Black and pale. Arms like bale. Milo blows a kiss.

"So, what did you get up to today?", sparks Mia. Hopeless in her crown. Treating each interaction as a tea party to be festooned by the etch of one's company. Milo interjects rudely. Furthermore, she no longer seems sober. I assume she popped a pill earlier when no one was looking. She places her arm around me and blurts.

### Milo Interjects

"Oh, you knoowww. Hangin' out. Gettin' naked. Havin' a quick fuck. Do you guys hang out much?" I was beginning to regret everything. Mia must have thought I was a fool, and it was clear Milo hadn't changed at all. Sickly n' irascibile. As impoverised in the misery which I too had in exceptional terms, pathetically pursued without discourse.

Drown me in cum and cry

An orgasm away from the reckless . Trapped inside the morose interlude of the cab interior, I couldn't have thought of anything more pleasant than to simply disappear into the void and never come back. Instead, I laid witness to everything I ever despised, now melting away into shades of grey I hadn't seen since high school. Passive in its dismantle. Modest in its self-harm. Ruthless. Agoraphobic. Questioning why I'd accepted a deal with the devil.

"Uh, we've met once. He helped me move some stuff into my apartment. Are you guys together?", responds Mia. Milo interjects again.

### Character Unsure of Milo

"Yes. We are, and you better believe it." She kisses me tautly on the cheek. Eyes


"Actually, we only


 I don't feel safe to respond, and yet it made me crave her more. I wanted to feel desired. To feel like a piece of meat being chewed on my two women, hastily fighting for my corpse.

I wasn't quite sure what I saw when I looked into Milo's eyes for a second time. It was as if the angel I'd envisioned had completely faded away; replaced by the deranged rhapsody of a murderous vixen. And yet she made me feel complete as a person. It felt as if we were the same person inside.

I couldn't stop staring at her ideal figure .

 and the confidence which

I internalise it as something sexual.

There was something archaic in the design of the cab, as if




You could tell he was having  . I noted not to shake his hand.

The driver spoke three different languages. Japanese, Chinese and Korean.


If I could fuck any emotion I would fuck sadness. It would be your most malleable best friend. It wouldn't care if you beat it, raped it or crushed into a thousand tiny pieces. It would persist in its grief, elated in the distress it had already come to expect of itself. Grateful in your neediness and desperate in your pleasure. It is what Gods come to expect of their young.

### Describe Stripmall

The Mexican restaurant made its home within the matchwood interiors of a refurbished Church, house to slurry of canned beans and quarter-ounce jars

### Describe Mexican Restaurant

The enchilada. An inoffensive mound of maize-infused goop, seared in a second-hand microwave oven on finance. The slosh hammock rolled around on my plate, mummified in a meat-cheese mixture of re-hydrated pus and freeze-dried caesin. A product they used to call 'vinyl chloride' back at the foundry.


### Emotions

Hid behind my over-sized sombrero, the streaming lights of the 8pm disco-ball.

## Scene 2 END


<!-- Maybe what happens is that Milo and the character go into the bathroom together. She has a fight with him about Mia and she hate fucks him. Then she leaves and breaks up with him. doesn't come back.

She thinks he's been fucking Mia.

In order to make this work, I need her to bring Mia up mid-way through sex. She makes him cum, pulls out just before, then slaps him across the face.

Maybe also when he heads back from the bathroom stall, Mia is bleeding. Milo punched her. Then in the bubble chapter, Milo is not found at work.
