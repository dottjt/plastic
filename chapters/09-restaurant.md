## Scene 1 START

### Describe Taxi Ride

One and three. 1 and 3. Left. Right. Tip. Tap. Winky fuckin' driver, racist casually. Soy boy, fun toy. Sudofed window stares. Two and four. 2 and 4. Steamroll grief machine. I was zero. I was 0. Sittin' in the middle. Country symptom blues. Even numbers by my side. Black and pale. Arms like bale. Milo blows me a kiss.

"So, what did you get up to today?", sparks Mia. Hopeless in her crown. Milo interjects.

### Milo Interjects

"Oh, you know. Hanging out. Do you guys hang out much?" I was beginning to regret everything. As I found myself trapped inside the morose interlude of the cab interior, now melting into shades of grey I hadn't seen since high school. Passive in its dismantle. Modest in its self-harm. Ruthless. Agoraphobic. Questioning why I'd accepted a deal with the devil.

"Uh, we've met once. He helped me move some stuff into my apartment. Are you guys together?", responds Mia. Milo interjects again.

The driver spoke three different languages. Japanese, Chinese and Korean.


If I could fuck any emotion I would fuck sadness. It would be your most malleable best friend. It wouldn't care if you beat it, raped it or crushed into a thousand tiny pieces. It would persist in its grief, elated in the distress it had already come to expect of itself. Grateful in your neediness and desperate in your pleasure. It is what Gods come to expect of their young.

### Describe Stripmall

The Mexican restaurant made its home within the matchwood interiors of a refurbished Church, house to slurry of canned beans and quarter-ounce jars



### Describe Mexican Restaurant

The enchilada. An inoffensive mound of maize-infused goop, seared in a second-hand microwave oven on finance. The slosh hammock rolled around on my plate, mummified in a meat-cheese mixture of re-hydrated pus and freeze-dried caesin. A product they used to call 'vinyl chloride' back at the foundry.


### Emotions

Hid behind my over-sized sombrero, the streaming lights of the 8pm disco-ball.

<!-- Maybe what happens is that Milo and the character go into the bathroom together. She has a fight with him about Mia and she hate fucks him. Then she leaves and breaks up with him. doesn't come back.

She thinks he's been fucking Mia.

In order to make this work, I need her to bring Mia up mid-way through sex. She makes him cum, pulls out just before, then slaps him across the face.

Maybe also when he heads back from the bathroom stall, Mia is bleeding. Milo punched her. Then in the bubble chapter, Milo is not found at work.
