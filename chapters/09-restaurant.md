## Scene 1 START - taxi.

### Describe Taxi Ride

One and three. 1 and 3. Left. Right. Tip. Tap. Winky fuckin' driver. The drink is casually racist. Soy boy sits with a Sudofed window shake. Red Raccoon crave; lavish lurch fringe. Two and four. 2 and 4. Steamroll grief machine. Even numbers by my side. Black and pale. Arms like bale. Milo blows a kiss.

"So, what did you get up to today?", sparks Mia. Hopeless in her crown. Treating each interaction as a tea party to be festooned by the etch of one's company. Milo interjects rudely. Furthermore, she no longer seems sober. I assume she popped a pill earlier when no one was looking. She places her arm around me and blurts.

### Milo Interjects

"Oh, you knoowww. Hangin' out. Gettin' naked. Havin' a quick fuck. Do you guys hang out much?" I was beginning to regret everything. Mia must have thought I was a fool, and it was clear Milo hadn't changed at all. Sickly n' irascibile. As impoverised in the misery which I too had in exceptional terms, mindlessly pursued without discourse. I was merely one orgasm away from the reckless . Trapped inside the morose interlude of the cab interior, I couldn't have thought of anything more pleasant than to simply disappear into the void and never come back. Instead, I laid witness to everything I ever despised, now melting away into shades of grey I hadn't seen since high school. Passive in its dismantle. Modest in its self-harm. Ruthless. Agoraphobic. Questioning why I'd accepted a deal with the devil. I felt like cumming in Milo's eye, but I doubt the driver would let me get away with it.

"Uh, well we met once in the corridor. He helped me move some stuff into my apartment. Are you guys together?". Milo was keen to interject, but she was in no state to comment. The inner workings of her brain had collapsed into a child-like sludge of meandering depravation. It was both beautiful and scarce. It was distinctly the Milo I both loved and needed to get away from. I decided to interject.

### Character Unsure of Milo

"We know each other from work. I think she's a little ...uh, not quite here." I wasn't quite sure if Mia was the kind of person to take drugs. I pictured she was the kind of person who wasn't opposed to the idea of taking drugs. Simply that her friends weren't complete trash; something which I had begun to realise about my own. Milo attempts to kiss me on the cheek, but instead faceplants into my lap. Drool abound on my crotch. It looked like we were in for a long night.

### Character And Mia

Mia looked unsettled at the situation, perhaps witness to a side of my life she hadn't yet been exposed to. To our north, my friend had the driver caught in a vapid pauperisation of the quantum exaggeration, as he attempted to tell a story about how he managed to trek through the bush with only a knife and a compass. Milo on the other hand and completely left the scene; replaced by the drug-fucked interior of hyper-aggressive ambivalence. Sway to the voiceless disaffection of her apathy, that she wore in fear at the anarchy of her own life. Mia and I looked at each other with an understanding of the surrounding lawlessness of the situation. It brought us closer together. I wanted to hold her hand.

### Describe Mia

Mia was the kind of person that you'd wished you'd met in high school. Cheerful. Clever.

### Describe Cab

There was something archaic in the design of the cab, as if


### Milo Regret

I wasn't quite sure what I saw when I looked into Milo's eyes for a second time. It was as if the angel I'd envisioned had completely faded away; replaced by the deranged rhapsody of a murderous vixen. And yet she made me feel complete as a person. It felt as if we were the same person inside.

I internalise it as something sexual.

### Arrival At Restaurant

## Scene 2 START


### Describe Restaurant Outside

The Mexican restaurant made its home within the matchwood interiors of a refurbished Church, house to slurry of canned beans and quarter-ounce jars


### Describe Mexican Restaurant

The enchilada. An inoffensive mound of maize-infused goop, seared in a second-hand microwave oven on finance. The slosh hammock rolled around on my plate, mummified in a meat-cheese mixture of re-hydrated pus and freeze-dried caesin. A product they used to call 'vinyl chloride' back at the foundry.

### Milo Calls Me Into Bathroom

Milo disappears into the bathroom.


### At Bathroom

"Is everything okay?"


### Milo Fucks Character

Milo begins


### Emotions

Hid behind my over-sized sombrero, the streaming lights of the 8pm disco-ball.

## Scene 3 END

<!-- Maybe what happens is that Milo and the character go into the bathroom together. She has a fight with him about Mia and she hate fucks him. Then she leaves and breaks up with him. doesn't come back.

She thinks he's been fucking Mia.

In order to make this work, I need her to bring Mia up mid-way through sex. She makes him cum, pulls out just before, then slaps him across the face.

Maybe also when he heads back from the bathroom stall, Mia is bleeding. Milo punched her. Then in the bubble chapter, Milo is not found at work.
