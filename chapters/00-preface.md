I would like to preface this writing by stating that I'm fine. Fine in the sense of function. Fine in the sense of control.

Although this novel expresses some very dark and unforgiving tones, it is because I love expression itself. I love feeling. I love exploring. I love grabbing and pulling and shoving and the interactions that arise between words of an ill-nature.

I suppose it dives deeper into this question of what makes an emotion or a feeling real? I'll leave that for you to decide. I am just the medium, after all.
