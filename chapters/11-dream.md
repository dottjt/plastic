I could feel her holding me.


## Scene 3 START - sex.

### Describe Feelings

I'm covered in the silk of my own drool. She's right besides me. It was perfect. She was perfect. The perfect image of me. Everything my heart desired in the punishing impulsiveness which was her fabled dreamscape of a errorless body. Those perky nipples,

Even to this day, I have no possible idea how we managed to get home in the state that we were in, however

### Describe Sex

She pushed me into the front door. We started making out. Her tongue against mine. Guiding me without evidence. She pushes her torso against mine, reaching for my pants. This is what I wanted. This is who she was, and this is what I'd dreamed of experiencing from the moment I saw her.

We reach my bedroom. I couldn't stop looking into her eyes. In a sense, I couldn't tell if she happy, sad . It was as if she was . As if deep down inside she was actually mentally running away from herself. From her life, and I was merely an outlet for it all.

She gets on top of me.




<!-- ## Scene 1 START

### Expressing love

An acoustic stream of pink decorations fluttered around me, gently letting me down ina a confetti of fairy dust. I couldn't have imagined anything more perfect than the sanctuary of her presence, held in esteem beyond the very words which brought her to life. More than anything, I simply wanted to hold her in my hand, pretending to be hers in every sense of the word. A lucky charm of eternity which

I could have stared at her for hours, absorbing the finer details of her skin. Hold her tight

The perfect image of cuckholdry

I could feel her body pressed against mine. The soft touch of her pores



So this is what love was. A pure evaporation if cynicism, .


. It was like staring at a godess.


She's distant.

### Waking up with Milo

 I was ecstatic.

The air was thin this morning. It had been quite cold recently, and I wasn't quite sure

"I think I have a condition."

"Fuck, you don't have syphilis, do you?", she spouted in an over-reaction of concern, hugging the bed-sheets in a last bastion of earthly safety.

"Oh no, it's not that.

"Try and talk about your mental il=ln

### Talk about making breakfast together.

"Wet cake makes for a soppy treat," she announces, floating her way to the heel of my toes, t-shirt draped across her bare shoulders.

### Breaking point.

(maybe make it about trust issues)

## Scene 2 START


### The breakup.

"I don't think I can do this anymore. I like you n' all, and I think you're a really smart and funny guy, but you're just not really my type."

My first reaction was to vomit. Either because I felt I deserved the pain of wretching my guts out, or because I felt so sick that I didn't know how else to respond.


 How does one feel rejection when they already live and breathe it by mere fracture of their existence?

"What do you mean? What more is there than being smart or funny?", I recited, following a long careful examination of the situation. Truth was, I was devastated.


### She leaves.

My first reaction once she'd left was to masturbate. It was remained in the sunken realisation that all hope had decided to evade me, leaving my corspe in a
