### Magazine Monologue
<!--
"10 Hot Tips For Amazing, Mind-Blowing Sex." The front cover of every men's magazine. Sizing and measuring you down to the retrofit standard, just like the piece of shit you are. That glorious accolade of levity opportune. To be printed at birth upon a thin laminate of unmet judgement, stapled to your forehead and published to thy data centre. Nearest to thy heart.

"I am an average half-male Asian with an overwhelming propensity for sticking my penis into the hulls of pretentious white women," states my labellum. Illustrated in a beautiful Iranian typeface, extracted from page five of a ten-part contemporary guide to desktop publishing. How glorious, you must say. Well, quite glorious indeed, if I don't say myself. I place the magazine down onto the polyvinyl coffee table in front of me, offering no illusions under the innocuous litter of garbled reading material laid before my crest. As the pages attempt to tingle n' conspire round the hot-rolled furlough of the treated walnut precipice below. Startling themselves into a feint gloria of reprise, begging me for their tender gorge n' retention. Cream upon the furtative tint of the pandamorium alyis we lust, constructed from the boredom of one's own mind. The guttural in high. My face begins to ponder, melting me into the crown of my seat like loom. Evidently, today had already become far too much for these heavy, virulent hands. The monologue begins.

### Hopeless Monologue

"We try to love ourselves." We try to breathe meaning into our pursuits and desires, providing them with gloss and texture to make our lives appear more decorative than they truly are. We try to shower our souls in the finest of ingredients and with the most decadent of minds, only to perceive flaw in the underlying aberration of our spluttering plyth. Surreal in its prolific marvel of tantamount clutter, tearing and hemorrhaging us apart like the gutted hulls of a Hallowe'en pumpkin. Pluvial in its mash. Gauss in its hovel. Perfectly rigid in its asinine classification of dirt n' other insignificant oddities. For the cruel is a place for all your hopes and dreams, those unwritten lies of youth, to be lavishly processed under the laborious eye of an obscure Japanese algorithm. As it lauds n' extols over its antediluvian lambast of Harajuku fleece n' floozy Kigurumi men, emulated via a 1994 ANSI standard of comparative Lisp; steady with a dash of Cobol to boot. As it teams with a doubt you so solemnly believed was a mere anti-pattern to be corrected by the engineers over at Google. Castigate, you stupid fool.

### Describe Boredom

I stare into the palm of my hand with the attention of a spider. Curling my lips with the ply of my tongue. Appearing granular in the linguistic irrelevance of these abstruse words; tectonic in the fibre-optic lunacy looming from the hoards of discretion receding from my mouth. Germane is a gloat. FUCK. An empire of afterthought dismantles before your very eyes, plagued by a scourge of famished locusts, as they contemplate their regular routine of savage deconstruction in a structured alimony of incarnate n' curriculum. The gravy train is cold. The spire lingers. The wind rushes across your face amidst an ethereal typhoon of relentless jabbing. Terribly broken. Quieten ziplock. I hush back to the comfort of my gamboling pirouette, solidly uncertain of who I was in this very moment. Glazing over my vision. Classically trained, perhaps. Contemplating an existence which refused to feed. Splendid in the repulsion which only I understood; peachy to a point of demise. Wavering. Piteous. Congenital in its touch. Unrequited in its idyllic hold. I grab taste of the blood seeping from my upper lip, accidentally bitten in a trove of compound anxiety. Crony. The air was stale, and the faultless promise of a better life was nowhere to be found.

### Describe Foul Lady

Oh, and the smell. The fucking smell had become UNBEARABLE. It had transgressed into a visually stained splotch of acidic discharge, spread thin amongst a gelatinous estuary of fangled hoisery n' speckled period blood. As its loathsome willow peered into my tolerance, squalidly disconcerned with all aspects of my avid disaffection with the foul of this world. The cellulite of her diamond-crust thighs, found venerated in the exfoliated skin of a burn-victim's crotch. Left to disintegrate under the shoveled distress of an effluent highway of pig's guts n' dog's shit. It was none other than the tangled odor of the old shriveled cretin sitting to my right, as she proceeded to cross her gnarled flaps thrice; prompting me to gag in a marrow vomit of scented decomposition. The witch must be removed. Tortured. Molested. Raped at the stake. I wanted nothing more than to rip the flitted flesh from her bloodied hymen, as a means to fuck the wound with a fistful of detol, until I could smell the overwhelming silence of bleach. Trickling from the hyperglycemic depths of her fetid vagina. Cursory to death. Gosh. Where was my therapist so I could fuck her? In dear solemn, I felt uneasy amongst my thoughts. As they provided a level of self-violation well-beyond even my own ability to curate. I stare at the malodorous woman with an auspicious eye. She stares back. Suckle my lunt, you clitch.

### Clinic Lobby

I sat there in the lobby of the clinic, mired in a thick scrub of southern indigestion. Stomach gurglin'. Leer vypin'. Synthetic feelin' with a quaint jeer of revulsion du jour, as I proceeded to lick the tips of my exquisite fingers. Flippin' through the sham that was last week's editorial. Published by a feminist with the opinion of a clown. The crisis of the patriarchy. The spate of Iran. The oppression of le Cheezel. Well, I suppose she wasn't wrong. I blink bristly at the awful stench sitting beside me, shooing her away with the ghast of my hwang. As I hiss into her general direction without recess. Observing her mull into the frilled hairs of her battered chin, allure upon a thick duvet of rat fur. As she sat there irritated, catatonic in a disasterous cough of prune juice n' pea. Voluptuously sipping her sturdy canister of ethical soda, kept close to her diluted chest. Conveniently strapped to a volcanic slime of pink jello n' sodium nitride, now teetering from the edge of her gums. Rustling against the lude careen of her mundane jowls. Biffin delure. Pockey O'Harris. She had become the spewin' daffney of a frail iron harp; the pristine sweater of a thousand nylon faces. Vile in her plume of fashionably unfashionable faux pas. I see yellow. And grey. The impressionable statement of a loose flower imprint. I suppose she was beautiful by human standards, if ever such a thing could occur. Like an obtuse quartet of despicable orange. A quick fuck before a heart attack flick fluck shluck. Balsamic in a never-ending orgasm like the strobelight of a underground nightclub, agonising her clit in ravage of demure. No wonder she was in therapy. Certainly, I doubt that she would ever have the potential to become a good mother. Not with an octogenarian face like that. Fictitious munt.

Now, to say that I hated therapy was an understatement. I couldn't possibly have thought of anything more pointless, nor contrived, than to explain why I was so fundamentally flawed in the most cantankerous of ways. "I'm retarded, missy. I think it might be because I use the word faggot too much." I doubt she even knew what the word faggot meant, let alone why it was used so liberally to describe the conundrum of my disguise. Lurking in sinster dupree. Squalid without even a hint of surprise. Therapy, in my opinion, was nothing more than an excuse to taunt n' prey upon those more helpless than thyself. Crass upon the emotionless blemish of a clinical psychopath, extensive in her doctorate of dialectic primatology. Forever examining my white ideals of Dorian pleasure in a grand game of cuck n' pittance. And finally, in what seemed like an ungracious eternity, the distraction of the hour finally arrives to the podium to call my name. Croaking melodically as if Sunday had just arrived. Inviting me to her lair. Drawing me into her cosy dungeon of inadequate maltreatment, as she gestured my soul to sit down upon the fading fabric of her previous victim's nightwatch. Grooming me with her promises of tap water, uncompromising in her dollar-shop fantasia of tourmaline glitter. In purpose, we must. She recieves one of my pennilessness smirks, before I decide to place my plastic cup back into the calm of my lap. In shineth we chime, you horrid bitch. Urticaria sun. Fortuna o' grace.

## Scene 2 START - therapy.

### Therapy - Expresses his feelings.

"Well for starters... I disowned my mother," I began. Pretending as if I were actually being interviewed for a cordial position on Saturday Night Live. The flair of my unassuming conceit, cashed against the alter-ego of my sometimes hilarity. The stunning chalcedony of a mere amateur. I gleamed into her eyes with a promissory tone of calcic observation, taking note of the bright green earrings which dangled from her ears like a freckled bouillie. Surely it was an amiable gift from an astute admirer, as she wore what appeared to be a handbag for a husband. As per usual, my therapist was unimpressed with my lack of commitment to the dread. Visually, she was uninspired by my tatty remark. Perhaps remnant of an orgasm she experienced 25 years ago during a extraordinarilyextraordinarily fatuous episode of Seinfeld. I didn't dare to proclaim.

The therapist was a cold shoulder of hate n' posterity. Ludicrous in her preposterous interrogations, which bordered dyslexic in the implausible hum of inconsequence which scowled from her tongue. At best she was an incomplete set of peevish narratives, detailing the mischief she insinuated upon 20th century men via the discarded tape recorders she kept to reinforce her ego. Like a vacuum of utilitarian comfort, designed to suck the joy and pleasure from the basic necessities of human life itself. A method she eneveloped into a haptic frenzy of uncompromising hand gestures and seizure-inducing flashes; the kind of foreplay she paid good money for. How quaint. Yet, there was something comforting in the brown cardigans n' tennis trainers she bore. As if to suggest that she simply didn't care for the deep layers of cat hair which preoccupied her blouse, nor whether she'd even remembered to brush her teeth that day. Much like my dearest Milo. Of course, it was my mission as a male to fuck everything and anything that moved. So the sentiment served as merely another discomfort I was expected to repress. She continued to study me.

"...aaaaaand I've been dumped, and I pretty much want to kill myself." I doubt she picked up on the sarcasm, although it would have been nice to at least haved heard a giggle. Laugh you stupid whore. Appease this comical foundry of foresaken witness, demoralised by thee rotten consternation. Apparently the suicide-themed zinger had not only confused her, but had been sternly tossed aboard under the sterling judgement of her crabby crab crim. In a lot of ways, our interaction was a golden marriage turned sour. Sheath in the dried husk of coconut peat I would soon describe as her vagina. Although I suppose it was in my best interest to throw her a bone during these hungry, hungry times. I was beginning to feel sorry for her, and these precious ears were dying for some closure.

### Therapy - Response.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I was just joking. There's a lot going on in my life at the moment." She continued to eye me with a dim falsetto, before finally deciding to chime in to the network of my woes. Only 4 minutes 32 seconds into our session. A new record in this dime of dimes.

"I understand that it must have been difficult. Would you like to talk about it?" Outstanding professionalism.

### Therapy - The guilt he feels for his mother.
-->
Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't. Perhaps I wasn't ready to admit that I was an awful human being. Perhaps I didn't trust her. Why was I even here? My neck began to tighten. I reached out into the depths of my brain, hoping to discover something rational in amongst the recreation ween of my teenage mind. Obsessed with the nitrogenous oxidation of sex, streaming down my arms in a slurry of poriferous sorrow. Administered in candentation. Pleading to be filled. Overflowing in thirst. As I sat there in the zenith of the harbinger chair, bought on the back of an unpayable student loan, it was clear that my mind was in no place to belong. To breathe. To relate. Paralysed by the volume of emotion which kept me up at night. Chide in their snicker. I mean, how does one express the guilt, sadness and anger that one feels, without breaking down into a puddle of harangue puree? Peddlin' in circles. Lipid at the substrate. The reminder had already triggered my depression, so I decided to go off on a tangent.

### Therapy: What is success?

"Maybe I just don't feel successful," I uttered to the therapist. She knew I was bluffing, but I suppose it was more than I deserved.

"Well, what's your idea of success?" the therapist responded.

"I don't know. Maybe it's having sex three times a week with a hooker who'll remember my name. I guess I just want to feel less terrible about everything." These were the words which dispersed from my mouth, as I dipped my face into a plastic cup of water like a stubborn penguin. Suckling the remaining few drops I'd clearly already finshed, if only because I felt anxious sharing the hollow life that laid before me. Perishing in a pool of lethargy.

"What do you think success would feel like?"

"I'm not sure. I guess I would be happy with my life. Like I'd achieved a lot or become famous, or something," I said.

"And do you think it's possible to feel be without having achieved a lot or without becoming famous?" Fucking bitch. I knew she had me. I fuckin' knew it, as the tight-lipped dryness in her eyes protruded from her soul and grabbed me by the throat, like a telescopic rape device. I should have clocked the bitch while I had the chance.

"I don't know, maybe. But what's point in being happy if you're not successful?" HA. Die you insufferable bitch. Certainly, I doubt she was pleased to deal with my inane bullshit on a Sunday at 10am in the morning, as she sat there pondering about the ambiguous state of her frozen eggs, suspended in a vat of pickle juice to be extracted and adorned once her online dating profile had come to full fruition. "It's only a matter of time now," she'd utter to herself in a fiendish tone, drizzled in an indignant ambivalence of sexual unrest, awaiting patiently to ensnare her personal toy-boy of lust n' pleasure. Perhaps I was on the list.

"Maybe you don't quite know what you want because your idea of what you think you want, success, or at least your idea of success as a list of things to achieve, differs from how you want to feel. Which is happy, which arguably is completely independent of success itself" she said.

### Discuss Happiness

I wasn't quite sure what to think, but at the very least I knew that my interaction with the therapist didn't make me happy. Although perhaps nothing would. I suppose happiness had never really been one of my great aspirations in life. In fact, it wasn't a subject I really thought about at all. It was more a quirky nice-to-have, like a side of fries with a dab of Tabasco sauce. A never-ceasing sometimes pain, sometimes pleasure, which would sporadically appear at points throughout the day to remind you of your own mortality. Maybe what I truly wanted was to prove myself right against this bitch. Maybe that's what would make me happy. I decided to make myself happy.

"Aren't you going to ask me where Daddy touched me," I said, clearly getting on her nerves. Before she could fit in a word, I decided to take my plastic cup to the watercooler at the back of the room for a refill. Surely even she could tell I was getting dehydrated. Taking my time not to further defame my already ruined reputation as a potential sex offender. Yummy yummy. Let this whispy stranger take you away, little child, to a place your parents couldn't possibly imagine. Decipher that one, doc.

### Therapist Cracks

"Maybe we should end today's session here." Yes. Perhaps we should. Goodbye Brown Cardigan. You soulless bag of apples.

"And maybe I'm also not the right person to help you with your problems. You seem resistant to this idea that I can help you." Well, fuck. There ya have it folks. Discard the reminder. Throw out the bath water. There's fun to be had for all.

"I don't think you trust me to help you understand your own problems." Correct. I didn't trust her. I didn't trust her to understand my pain. I didn't trust to truly understand what it was like to even fathom the loneliness that held in highest regard. Although honestly, what difference did it make. I barely even trusted myself.

### Leaving Practice

I felt weary as I left the therapist's office. Blinded by a combination of fog and sun, as the shimmer of the dusk breeze light marooned across my eyelids in a tribal lull of pantomime idealisation. Ultimately feeling unsure about this whole "life" thing, just as I'd felt an hour earlier. As the non-clamateur puffed out of my lungs in a lapse of hard judgement, and onto a plate of sick. Designed to arouse the elderly into a covert sipple of dread. Consume like a thick gravy upon a tartare of pulverised mutton. Sully in the taint of these wretched hands, pulling my strings and caressing me with a demented kindness. Carelessly tilting me towards its touch of vice and candour. It was a loneliness reimagined for a smarter generation, delicate in its  in it's tinted  of cheerful carousel. Gathered in a grand court of caliph and vizier. Crowning hopelessness as its young new leader to guide and extrapolate, in this celebration of formal resignation. And yet life more often than not, felt more like a chore to be flung around, rather than a purpose to be held. Too exhausted to cry. Too manic to pretend. I wish I knew myself better beyond the plastic shadow which mimiced my words and

### Cynicism Monologue

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat-fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. Fuck you rabbit. Fuck you indeed.

I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull insensitivity to .

The orange agent places a sticker on your shoulder, congratulating you for your success, cackling delirious at the charity you demanded in the cusp of your two hands.

There are some with a fantasy to discuss a big-breasted child with a severe OCD for sucking cock.

Surely, in raptum we trust, you silly woman.

### Reimagining Therapy

A platter of unapologetic jelly splatters across your face, filling the hollow arteries of your veins with a sense of purpose not know since these words commanded God the pleasure of man. Fabled heroin masqueraded as a cheap 50 cent lice, tasty when chewed. And you know, since we're here to talk about life, let's discuss something more than the stars, the weather or the cookie-cutter commonality which extrudes itself from these dark coarse fabrics currently draping your electric gold. Your brain craves more than just crimson hue, and certainly can afford more than just the tart swine you reach and squander. It’s imperative that we take the excessive plastic off and exercise communication the old-fashioned way, with a gun and a cloud of nicotine vapour designed solely to penetrate your eyes and envelop curiosity in a way which floor would you into compliance.

Given our therapy session has officially begun, I think it’s worth mentioning a few things which I’m sure will help shape our timely discourse. Ultimately, I want you as the reader to take full-view of the Julius Reade TM experience as if you were the great man himself, cast dazzling in perfect tanned bronze upon a height of glory last emanated from the creation of the sun. Looking past the corruption and blatant animal abuse, I think there’s a lot to like about this guy. He lathers his tongue in a motion of self-loathing, and he encourages an agonising torment of indecision, abysmally profound in its making. The tribe gathers itself around the bounty, thrashing itself about in a sadistic two-time beat. The horrid grin slathers in a ritual known as the hoard, pertain to the long-lasting peace you've always desired. There's a knife on the table and Mr. Compadre sitting across from you has something to say. Let's see who can scream louder.

Certainly, I don't mean to offend you. I mean, don't like to split either, but words are designed to divide and that's precisely what I intend to do. To grab your imagination and divide, mimic and taunt the non-sensical derivative bordering your emotional instability which frankly speaking, should not be touched. Let us for a brief moment become savant together, and share these words without any consideration of the consequences which may ensue. Without any doubt in my mind, this book aims to be tactical in its abuse and

### Describe Yourself

So let me try and paint you a picture.

You’re a crispy Ted. Your haircut is an impression-less damp scruff of pastiche antiquity. I’ve never quite seen a suit so brown nor flavourless, and yet you have the confidence to match the dull-drudgery holding you down by your neck. A personality devoid of pleasure. Hell, I doubt even your own irony understands itself. Even what little you bring to the table, but I tell ya what, it’s real cackle to try and observe you attempt to arrange those i’s and o’s into some kind of logical alphabet soup, glisten to an audience privy to the self-abuse you provide. But the good news is that you’re loved. Yes, Mummy loves you. She craves you. Here’s an expired Campbell’s chicken soup she prepared earlier, even opened the can n’ everything. This soup was crafted with real tears, real buttery tears, the kind of tears only found in upper-market department stores and gold-plated Jewish morgues. The kind of soup that burns your throat and slashes your budget into a miserable low-digit summary. Yet Mummy is in a lot of pain, because you made her pussy bleed and now there’s a frail old lady on the floor, mummified in the nostalgia you once thought intangible. There are scars as thick as knife wounds, carved throughout the maze of willingness you expend

A finer touch if ever you demanded one, although as we both know, these words are nothing more than a trap our senses are both trying to fight. “It’s okay to burn”, preaches the local glass nun, shouting vast through these pages without even a hint of respite, white powder thick to her heels in a perfect mirage of gloss and so sheen. Ah yes, and just when you thought life’s searing gaze couldn’t get any worse, a talking Harry presents itself in full-fashion and it just doesn’t know when to stop. Shut up Harry. You violent Harry. Fucking Harry. I was sure she was being tart.

A mature fight-fighter with a body like a well-kept fire axe, covered in the tan ripple of a thoughtless afternoon, fucking your wife by the poolside as you watch by in self-justified shame.

Oh, and it seems that your fetish for Kigurumi men has been egregiously exposed to the world of online, now circulating aggressively to every single data centre across the country under the guise of marketing research. Congenital in its touch. Unrequited in its hold. Wholesome is thy neighbour. Be hound, be told.

I went to the cupboard for a bottle of jock.

And although my heart is currently beating under the false pretense of a meaningful life, all I can say is that the blackmail has become far too much for me to handle and I'd really appreciate it if you'd please PLEASE, for the love of God, just lean over my shoulder and tell me how WONDERFUL my smile is today. Oh, that was lovely. Thank you, Daddy. It's great you could make it. Yes, I love you too.

Melodramatic was the score.
