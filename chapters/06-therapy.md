## Scene 1 START

### Magazine

The front cover of every men's magazine. Sizing and measuring you down to the retrofit standard. That glorious award, to be printed at birth, stuck on your forehead and published to the nearest data collection centre, where it will be processed under the fine eye of a complex Japanese algorithm written in comparative lisp. "You are an average Asian male with an overwhelming propensity for sticking your penis into the wrinkled foreskin of pretentious white women," my label states, time-stamped in a beautiful font, extracted from a contemporary guide to desktop publishing. We try to love ourselves. We try to breathe meaning into our pursuits and leisures, providing them with hope and transparent textures to decorate our lives with, only to see them absorbed by a plague of locusts completing their regular routine around your ego.

### Clinic Lobby

I sat there in the lobby of the clinic. Digested. Flippin' through the sham of last week's editorial, published by a fat clown. Some bullshit about Iran. The revolutionary sand dunes of the mind. Carb crazy. A woman in a coat sippin' ethical soda by the gallon. Pink vagina. Purple heart. The breakin' daffney of a village school pen. Scratchity sun. A sweater with a nylon face. I see yellow. Flower imprint. I suppose she was beautiful by human standards, like a flickering light in the basement of an underground nightclub. A quick fuck before the heart attack. I certainly couldn't love her. Not with a face like that. The distraction calls my name. It was time for Sunday therapy. My least favourite part of the week.

To say that I hated therapy was an understatement. I couldn't possibly have thought of anything more pointless, than to explain why i, and yet here I was. At the same time every week.

### Therapy: What is success?

"The problem is that I don't feel successful," I uttered to the therapist, a cold shoulder of taut one-liners and intricately gross examinations which bordered on dyslexic. A siamese bucket of discarded tape recorders, patched together with the incomplete narratives of hollow young men. She truly was a vacuum of utilitarian comfort, designed to suck the joy and pleasure from basic human necessity, formulised in a haptic frenzy of uncompromising hand gestures and seizure-inducing flashes. Yet, there was something comforting in the brown cardigan which served solely as a dilapidated corkboard of cat hair and coffee stains. Truth is I'd always wanted to fuck my therapist. Actually it was fair to say that I was keen to fuck anything.

"Well, what's your idea of success?" the therapist responded.

"I don't know. Maybe it's having sex three times a week. Owning a home. I just don't feel successful," I said, as I dipped my face into my coffee cup like a stubborn penguin. In actual fact my dream was to become a writer. I'm not quite sure when the obsession began, but it was an all-consuming affair with my imagination. An innocent ploy for self-discovery, held in sanctuary by

"What do you think success would feel like?"

"I guess I would be happy. Possibly content and fulfilled with myself, like if felt a sense of confidence and pride in who I was," I said.

"And do you think you would it's possible to feel those things without success?" Fucking bitch. She had me. I knew she fuckin' had me, as the tight-lipped dryness in her eyes protruded like a telescopic rape device. I should have sued the bitch while I had the chance. I knew it wasn't a complete waste of time

"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe it is possible to be happy without chasing my ideas of success. But what point is being happy if you're not successful?" Certainly, I was doubtful she pleased to deal with my inane bullshit on a Friday at 10am, as she pondered the state of her frozen eggs, suspended in a vat of pickle-juice to be extracted once her online dating profile came to full fruition. "Only a matter of time now," she would utter to herself in a fiendish tone, waiting patiently to ensnare her personal toy-boy to be kept and pleasured. Although perhaps that was just her job.

"Well, what's the point of being successful if you're not happy? It sounds like you're not quite sure what it is you want. You view success as a list of objectives to complete, that you also seem to conflate with how you think it will make you feel." she said.

"So what should I do then? Should I just buy the kool-aid and just pursue mindless pleasures instead?"

"I wouldn't go to that extreme."

"So would say that you view success as a list of objectives to complete, that you conflate with how you feel?"

"What about being feeling itself? What value do you place on say, happiness?"

### Discuss Happiness

Happiness was never something that

I guess I've never really been happy.

It wasn't something you ever thought about.

"Would you say that success and happiness are not the same thing?"

"What about family? Friends?" Maybe

"Aren't you going to ask me where Daddy touched me," I said, clearly getting on her nerves. Okay, maybe I should be a little more accomodating.

### Therapy - Expresses his feelings.

"Well, for starters, I disowned my mum," I began, pretending as if I were actually being interviewed for a popular position on a TV show sitcom. I gleamed at her noticably, taking note of the bright green earrings she wore. An op-shop discount for a very special lady with a handbag for a husband. As per usual, the therapist was unimpressed with my lack of commitment. Perhaps she was even so uninspired by my tatty remark, that it caused her to activate the remote vibrator in her vagina, just to get a little kick out of my general . Certainly, I don't recommend sexualising disappointment, although it's a quick fix for what is essentially a poor choice in career. Go study economics instead.

"...aaaaaand I've been dumped, and I pretty much want to kill myself." I hope she picked up on the sarcasm. I also hoped she'd just drop dead on the floor and begin spasming on the ground, eager for my blunt hands to take advantage of her talcum'd breasts, but did it really even matter at this point? Can I please get an AMEN?

### Therapy - Response.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I'm just joking. There's just a lot going on in my life at the moment." She continued to eye me, before finally deciding to chime in.

"I understand that it must have been difficult. Would you like to talk about it?", she responded. Outstanding professionalism. The enema of politeness. Another fuck-hole with a source of intelligence. Thank god this program was Government funded.

### Therapy - The guilt he feels for his mother.

I reached out into the depths of my brain, hoping to find something rational to respond with. Truth was, there was simply too much to tell. How does one express the crushing guilt, sadness and anger that one feels, without pulling a gun out and simply allowing the remenants of reality speak for itself? I decided to grab myself a plastic cup of water from the watercooler in the room, taking my time not to further defame my already ruined reputation as a possible unrealised sex offender. Children too. Yummy yummy. Let this whispy stranger take you to a place your parents couldn't possibly imagine.

"I just feel bad about everything, you know? I feel guilty for the absolute hate I feel towards my mother, like that makes me a bad son. I feel cheated for being dumped. I just want something to workout for once in my life, but it just doesn't ever feel possible." Maybe she could help me afterall.






Truth is, the bitch had no idea what she was talkin' about.


I wanted to feel.

What did it mean to cope?


I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull insensitivity to .

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat-fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. Fuck you rabbit. Fuck you indeed.

## Scene 2 START

### Cynicism Monologue

The orange agent places a sticker on your shoulder, congratulating you for your success, cackling delirious at the charity you demanded in the cusp of your two hands.

There are some with a fantasy to discuss a big-breasted child with a severe OCD for sucking cock.

Surely, in raptum we trust, you silly woman.

### Success Conversation Again

"Do you think I'll ever become a successful writer?"

"I'm not sure if that's something I can answer. Although I imagine hard-work can take you a long way towards self-improvement."

### Reimagining Therapy

Apologetic jelly splatters across your face, filling the hollow arteries of your veins with a sense of purpose not know since these words commanded God the pleasure of man. Fabled heroin masqueraded as a cheap 50 cent lice, tasty when chewed. And you know, since we're here to talk about life, let's discuss something more than the stars, the weather or the cookie-cutter commonality which extrudes itself from these dark coarse fabrics currently draping your electric gold. Your brain craves more than just crimson hue, and certainly can afford more than just the tart swine you reach and squander. It’s imperative that we take the excessive plastic off and exercise communication the old-fashioned way, with a gun and a cloud of nicotine vapour designed solely to penetrate your eyes and envelop curiosity in a way which floor would you into compliance.

Given our therapy session has officially begun, I think it’s worth mentioning a few things which I’m sure will help shape our timely discourse. Ultimately, I want you as the reader to take full-view of the Julius Reade TM experience as if you were the great man himself, cast dazzling in perfect tanned bronze upon a height of glory last emanated from the creation of the sun. Looking past the corruption and blatant animal abuse, I think there’s a lot to like about this guy. He lathers his tongue in a motion of self-loathing, and he encourages an agonising torment of indecision, abysmally profound in it's making. The tribe gathers itself around the bounty, thrashing itself about in a sadistic two-time beat. The horrid grin slathers in a ritual known as the hoard, pertain to the long-lasting peace you've always desired. There's a knife on the table and Mr. Compadre sitting across from you has something to say. Let's see who can scream louder.

Certainly, I don't mean to offend you. I mean, don't like to split either, but words are designed to divide and that's precisely what I intend to do. To grab your imagination and divide, mimic and taunt the non-sensical derivative bordering your emotional instability which frankly speaking, should not be touched. Let us for a brief moment become savant together, and share these words without any consideration of the consequences which may ensue. Without any doubt in my mind, this book aims to be tactical in it's abuse and

### Describe Yourself

So let me try and paint you a picture.

You’re a crispy Ted. Your haircut is an impression-less damp scruff of pastiche antiquity. I’ve never quite seen a suit so brown nor flavourless, and yet you have the confidence to match the dull-drudgery holding you down by your neck. A personality devoid of pleasure. Hell, I doubt even your own irony understands itself. Even what little you bring to the table, but I tell ya what, it’s real cackle to try and observe you attempt to arrange those i’s and o’s into some kind of logical alphabet soup, glisten to an audience privy to the self-abuse you provide. But the good news is that you’re loved. Yes, Mummy loves you. She craves you. Here’s an expired Campbell’s chicken soup she prepared earlier, even opened the can n’ everything. This soup was crafted with real tears, real buttery tears, the kind of tears only found in upper-market department stores and gold-plated Jewish morgues. The kind of soup that burns your throat and slashes your budget into a miserable low-digit summary. Yet Mummy is in a lot of pain, because you made her pussy bleed and now there’s a frail old lady on the floor, mummified in the nostalgia you once thought intangible. There are scars as thick as knife wounds, carved throughout the maze of willingness you expend

### A finer touch if ever you demanded one, although as we both know, these words are nothing more than a trap our senses are both trying to fight. “It’s okay to burn”, preaches the local glass nun, shouting vast through these pages without even a hint of respite, white powder thick to her heels in a perfect mirage of gloss and so sheen. Ah yes, and just when you thought life’s searing gaze couldn’t get any worse, a talking Harry presents itself in full-fashion and it just doesn’t know when to stop. Shut up Harry. You violent Harry. Fucking Harry. I was sure she was being tart.

A mature fight-fighter with a body like a well-kept fire axe, covered in the tan ripple of a thoughtless afternoon, fucking your wife by the poolside as you watch by in self-justified shame.


### Therapist Cracks

"Maybe I'm not the right person to help you with your problems. You seem resistant to this idea that I can help you." Well, fuck. There ya have it folks. I was just another discarded reminder in this game of bastard cards.

"I don't think you trust me to help you understand your own problems." Correct. I didn't trust her. I didn't trust her to understand my pain. I didn't trust to truly understand what it was like to even fathom the loneliness that held itself in high regard. Maybe I didn't trust her because I was barely willing to trust myself.

### Leaving Therapy

I wasn't quite sure what to think as I left her practice, although I was becoming more and more unsure about everything in my life up until this point. All I knew were the wretched hands which pulled at my strings and caressed me with a demented kindness, carelessly tilting me towards it's touch of vice and candour. Loneliness reimagined for a smarter generation, delicate in it's illusions of happy-fun-time and cheerful carousel. Gathered in a grand court of vizier and caliph, hopelessness had crowned it's young new leader to guide and extrapolate, to celebrate in the formal resignation of the

Life more often than not, felt like a chore to be flung around, purported into a variety of situations which felt integral to my human, yet felt completely foreign and cold. Too exhausted to cry. Too manic to pretend. I wish I knew myself better beyond the plastic shadow which mimiced my words and

All I knew was that I still wanted to fuck her. Her long black hair tied into perfect ponytails, pulled back into my chest as I fucked her from behind. Something to take the edge off

The thoughts of man trapped in desperation, ready to tear through the fabric of reality leaving amonia .
