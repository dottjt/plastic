### Magazine Monologue
<!-- 
"10 Hot Tips For Amazing, Mind-Blowing Sex." The front cover of every men's magazine. Sizing and measuring you down to the retrofit standard, just like the piece of shit you are. That glorious accolade of levity opportune, to be printed at birth upon a thin laminate of unmet judgement. Stapled to your forehead and published to thy data centre, nearest to thy heart. "I am an average half-male Asian with an overwhelming propensity for sticking my penis into the hulls of pretentious white women," states my labellum, illustrated in a beautiful Iranian typeface. Extracted from page five of a ten-part contemporary guide to desktop publishing. How glorious, you must say. Well, quite glorious indeed, if I don't say myself.

We try to love ourselves. We try to breathe meaning into our pursuits and desires, providing them with gloss and texture to make our lives appear more decorative than they truly are. We try to shower our souls in the finest of ingredients and with the most decadent of minds, only to perceive flaw in the underlying aberration spluttering at our pith. Surreal in its clutter of prolific marvel, tearing and hemorrhaging us apart like the gutted hulls of a Hallowe'en pumpkin. Pluvial in its mash. Gauss in its hovel. Seemingly rigid in its asinine classification of dirt n' other insignificant peculiarities. It is a place for all your hopes and dreams, those unwritten lies of youth, to be lavishly processed under the laborious eye of an obscure Japanese algorithm. As it lauds n' extols over its antediluvian lambast of Harajuku fleece n' floozy Kigurumi men, emulated via a 1994 ANSI standard of comparative Lisp; steady with a dash of Cobol to boot. Teaming with the doubt you so solemnly believed was a mere anti-pattern to be corrected by the castigate engineers over at Google. You stupid fool.
-->

I stare into the palm of my hand with the attention of a spider. Curling my lips with the ply of my tongue. Granular in its linguistic irrelevance; tectonic in its fibre-optic lunacy of petty discretion. Germane is a gloat. FUCK. An empire of afterthought dismantles before your very eyes, absorbed and prolonged by a plague of famished locusts. Contemplating their regular routine of savage deconstruction around your two-part curriculum of structured alimony. Incarnate. The gravy train is cold. The wind rushes across your face amidst a typhoon of ethereal jabbing. The scene is broken. I hush back to the comfort of my gamboling pirouette, solidly uncertain of who I was in this very moment. My eyes remaining glazed over my vision. Classically trained, perhaps. Contemplating an existence which refused to feed. Perfect in the understanding of my own repulsion; feeding me to a point of demise. Wavering. Piteous. Congenital in its touch. Unrequited in its idyllic hold. I grab taste of the blood seeping from my upper lip, accidentally bitten from a trove of anxiety. Dear Santa had decided to stay.  

Oh, and the smell. The fucking smell had become UNBEARABLE. It had become a visually stained splotch of acidic discharge, spread thin amongst a gelatinous estuary of fangled hoisery and speckled period blood. Peering into my tolerance. Squalid disaffection. Venerated in the exfoliated skin of a burn-victim's crotch, left to disintegrate under the shoveled distress of an effluent highway of pig's guts n' dog's breath. It was the repetitious odor of the old shriveled cretin sitting to my right, as she proceeded to cross her gnarled flaps a third time; prompting me to gag in a marrow vomit of scented decomposition. She must be removed. Tortured. Raped. I wanted nothing more in this moment than to rip the flitted flesh from her bloodied hymen, as a means to fuck the wound with a fistful of detol until I could smell the overwhelming silence of bleach. Trickling from the hyperglycemic depths of her fetid vagina. Cursory to death. Gosh. Where was my therapist at so I could fuck her? You know, perhaps I'd come to the right place after all. Suckle my lunt, you clitch.

### Clinic Lobby

I sat there in the lobby of the clinic, mired in a thick scrub of indigestion. Stomach gurglin'. Feelin' synthetic with a quaint jeer of repulsive du jour, as I licked the tips of my exquisite fingers. Flippin' through the sham that was last week's editorial, published by a feminist with the opinion of a clown. The crisis of the patriarchy. The spate of Iran. The oppression of le Cheezel. Well, I suppose she wasn't wrong. I blink bristly at the awful stench sitting next to me, shooing her away with the ghast of my presence. Hissing without recess. Observing her mull into the frilled hairs which stood allure upon the thick duvet of her battered chin, as she sat there irritated, catatonic in a disasterous cough of prune juice n' pea. Voluptuously sipping from her sturdy canister of ethical soda, kept close to her diluted chest. Conveniently strapped to a volcanic slime of pink jello n' sodium nitride, now teetering from the edge of her gums. Rustling against the lude careen of her mundane jowls. Biffin delure. Pockey O'Harris. She had become the spewin' daffney of a frail iron harp; the pristine sweater of a thousand nylon faces. Vile in her plume of fashionably unfashionable faux pas. I see yellow. And grey. The impressionable statement of a loose flower imprint. I suppose she was beautiful by human standards, if ever such a thing could occur. Like an obtuse quartet of despicable orange. A quick fuck before a heart attack flick fluck shluck. Balsamic in a never-ending orgasm like the strobelight of a underground nightclub, agonising her clit in ravage of demure. No wonder she was in therapy. Certainly, I doubted that she had the potential to be a good mother. Not with an octogenarian face like that. Stupid munt.

Now, to say that I hated therapy was an understatement. I couldn't possibly have thought of anything more pointless, nor contrived, than to explain why I was so fundamentally flawed in the most specific of ways. "I'm retarded, missy. I think it might be because I use the word faggot too much." I doubt she even knew what the word 'faggot' meant. I mean, did I even know? At the very least, it was an excuse to taunt and prey upon someone more helpless than myself. Crass upon the emotionless blemish of a clinical psychopath with an extensive doctorate in dialectic primatology, forever examining my white ideals of Dorian pleasure in a grand game of therapist n' scholar. And finally, in what seemed like an eternity, the distraction of this hour finally finds the time to call my name. Croaking melodically as if Sunday had just arrived. Inviting me to her lair. Drawing me into her cosy dungeon of inadequate mistreatment, as she gestured me to sit down upon the fading fabric of her previous victim's nightwatch. Grooming me with the promise of tap water. She was smart, but I was glitter. Purpose, we must. I gave her one of my casual sheers before placing my plastic cup onto the table in front of me. Glorious

It was time to shine. Urticaria sun. Fortuna grace.

### Therapy - Expresses his feelings.

"Well, for starters, I disowned my mother," I began, pretending as if I were actually being interviewed for a spot on Saturday Night Live. Cashed in an alter-ego of hilarity. The stunning of remarks of a mere amateur. I gleamed at her with a promissory tone of observation, taking note of the bright green earrings which dangled from her ears like a freckled bouillie. Surely, an op-shop discount for a special lady wearing a handbag for a husband. As per usual, the therapist was unimpressed with my lack of commitment to the process. Visually she was uninspired by my tatty remark, remnant of an orgasm she had 25 years ago during an episode of Seinfeld. The therapist was a cold shoulder of taut one-liners and intricately gross examinations which bordered on dyslexic. A siamese bucket of discarded tape recorders, patched together with the incomplete narratives of hollow young men. She truly was a vacuum of utilitarian comfort, designed to suck the joy and pleasure from basic human necessity, formulised in a haptic frenzy of uncompromising hand gestures and seizure-inducing flashes. Yet, there was something comforting in the brown cardigan which served solely as a dilapidated corkboard of cat hair and coffee stains. Truth is I'd always wanted to fuck my therapist. Actually it was fair to say that I was keen to fuck anything. She continued to study me.

"...aaaaaand I've been dumped, and I pretty much want to kill myself." I doubt she picked up on the sarcasm, although it would have been nice to at least receive a giggle of some sort. To appease the comical foundry of suicide throwin' zingers under the seering judgement of a crabby ol' bitch. In a lot of ways, our interaction felt a bit like a golden marriage turned sour. I'll spare you the details, but let's just say that it's hard to fuck a dried husk of coconut peat without feeling the burn.

### Therapy - Response.

"Listen, I'm sorry. I'm just joking. There's just a lot going on in my life at the moment." She continued to eye me, before finally deciding to chime in. 4 minutes 32 seconds into our session. A new record.

"I understand that it must have been difficult. Would you like to talk about it?" Outstanding professionalism.

### Therapy - The guilt he feels for his mother.

I reached out into the depths of my brain, hoping to find something rational to please her with. Truth was, there was simply too much to tell. How does one express the guilt, sadness and anger that one feels, without pulling a gun to their head in a misery of show n' tell? I was lost. I decided to go off on a tangent.

### Therapy: What is success?

"Maybe I just don't feel successful in life," I uttered to the therapist.

"Well, what's your idea of success?" the therapist responded.

"I don't know. Maybe it's having sex three times a week with a hooker who'll remember my name. I guess I just want to feel less terrible about everything." These were the words which dispersed from my mouth, as I dipped my face into a plastic cup of water like a stubborn penguin. Suckling the remaining few drops I'd clearly already finshed, if only because I felt anxious sharing the hollow life that laid before me. Perishing in a pool of lethargy.

"What do you think success would feel like?"

"I'm not sure. I guess I would be happy with my life. Like I'd achieved a lot or become famous, or something," I said.

"And do you think it's possible to feel be without having achieved a lot or without becoming famous?" Fucking bitch. I knew she had me. I fuckin' knew it, as the tight-lipped dryness in her eyes protruded from her soul and grabbed me by the throat, like a telescopic rape device. I should have clocked the bitch while I had the chance.

"I don't know, maybe. But what's point in being happy if you're not successful?" HA. Die you insufferable bitch. Certainly, I doubt she was pleased to deal with my inane bullshit on a Sunday at 10am in the morning, as she sat there pondering about the ambiguous state of her frozen eggs, suspended in a vat of pickle juice to be extracted and adorned once her online dating profile had come to full fruition. "It's only a matter of time now," she'd utter to herself in a fiendish tone, drizzled in an indignant ambivalence of sexual unrest, awaiting patiently to ensnare her personal toy-boy of lust n' pleasure. Perhaps I was on the list.

"Maybe you don't quite know what you want because your idea of what you think you want, success, or at least your idea of success as a list of things to achieve, differs from how you want to feel. Which is happy, which arguably is completely independent of success itself" she said.

### Discuss Happiness

I wasn't quite sure what to think, but at the very least I knew that my interaction with the therapist didn't make me happy. Although perhaps nothing would. I suppose happiness had never really been one of my great aspirations in life. In fact, it wasn't a subject I really thought about at all. It was more a quirky nice-to-have, like a side of fries with a dab of Tabasco sauce. A never-ceasing sometimes pain, sometimes pleasure, which would sporadically appear at points throughout the day to remind you of your own mortality. Maybe what I truly wanted was to prove myself right against this bitch. Maybe that's what would make me happy. I decided to make myself happy.

"Aren't you going to ask me where Daddy touched me," I said, clearly getting on her nerves. Before she could fit in a word, I decided to take my plastic cup to the watercooler at the back of the room for a refill. Surely even she could tell I was getting dehydrated. Taking my time not to further defame my already ruined reputation as a potential sex offender. Yummy yummy. Let this whispy stranger take you away, little child, to a place your parents couldn't possibly imagine. Decipher that one, doc.

### Therapist Cracks

"Maybe we should end today's session here." Yes. Perhaps we should. Goodbye Brown Cardigan. You soulless bag of apples.

"And maybe I'm also not the right person to help you with your problems. You seem resistant to this idea that I can help you." Well, fuck. There ya have it folks. Discard the reminder. Throw out the bath water. There's fun to be had for all.

"I don't think you trust me to help you understand your own problems." Correct. I didn't trust her. I didn't trust her to understand my pain. I didn't trust to truly understand what it was like to even fathom the loneliness that held in highest regard. Although honestly, what difference did it make. I barely even trusted myself.

### Leaving Practice

I felt weary as I left the therapist's office. Blinded by a combination of fog and sun, as the shimmer of the dusk breeze light marooned across my eyelids in a tribal lull of pantomime idealisation. Ultimately feeling unsure about this whole "life" thing, just as I'd felt an hour earlier. As the non-clamateur puffed out of my lungs in a lapse of hard judgement, and onto a plate of sick. Designed to arouse the elderly into a covert sipple of dread. Consume like a thick gravy upon a tartare of pulverised mutton. Sully in the taint of these wretched hands, pulling my strings and caressing me with a demented kindness. Carelessly tilting me towards its touch of vice and candour. It was a loneliness reimagined for a smarter generation, delicate in its illusions of cheerful carousel. Gathered in a grand court of caliph and vizier. Crowning hopelessness as its young new leader to guide and extrapolate, in this celebration of formal resignation. And yet life more often than not, felt more like a chore to be flung around, rather than a purpose to be held. Too exhausted to cry. Too manic to pretend. I wish I knew myself better beyond the plastic shadow which mimiced my words and

### Cynicism Monologue

So here I am. It's post-cull and it's killing season. I have my rifle, my ammunition and as you can see, attached to my belt-buckle is the first kill for the afternoon. Unfortunately the fat-fuck couldn't waddle away fast enough to mummy's comfort, so I killed the entire family and here I am prodding away at a dead carcass with my great big fucking sword. Fuck you rabbit. Fuck you indeed.

I feel unadjusted. I feel unprepared for a life without meaning, though perhaps I'm simply unable to produce meaning without spreading my intellectual tar as a gift to the inconsequence slicing me open. It's a delicate buffet, so please dig in. An unpleasant feeling, a kind of surreal suffocation, that blinds me as welcomingly as it graces. I would happily equate it to grafting impure enamel into the soft edges of my eye-lids, allowing me to process what little conscious thought I have towards cultivating my dull insensitivity to .

The orange agent places a sticker on your shoulder, congratulating you for your success, cackling delirious at the charity you demanded in the cusp of your two hands.

There are some with a fantasy to discuss a big-breasted child with a severe OCD for sucking cock.

Surely, in raptum we trust, you silly woman.

### Reimagining Therapy

Apologetic jelly splatters across your face, filling the hollow arteries of your veins with a sense of purpose not know since these words commanded God the pleasure of man. Fabled heroin masqueraded as a cheap 50 cent lice, tasty when chewed. And you know, since we're here to talk about life, let's discuss something more than the stars, the weather or the cookie-cutter commonality which extrudes itself from these dark coarse fabrics currently draping your electric gold. Your brain craves more than just crimson hue, and certainly can afford more than just the tart swine you reach and squander. It’s imperative that we take the excessive plastic off and exercise communication the old-fashioned way, with a gun and a cloud of nicotine vapour designed solely to penetrate your eyes and envelop curiosity in a way which floor would you into compliance.

Given our therapy session has officially begun, I think it’s worth mentioning a few things which I’m sure will help shape our timely discourse. Ultimately, I want you as the reader to take full-view of the Julius Reade TM experience as if you were the great man himself, cast dazzling in perfect tanned bronze upon a height of glory last emanated from the creation of the sun. Looking past the corruption and blatant animal abuse, I think there’s a lot to like about this guy. He lathers his tongue in a motion of self-loathing, and he encourages an agonising torment of indecision, abysmally profound in its making. The tribe gathers itself around the bounty, thrashing itself about in a sadistic two-time beat. The horrid grin slathers in a ritual known as the hoard, pertain to the long-lasting peace you've always desired. There's a knife on the table and Mr. Compadre sitting across from you has something to say. Let's see who can scream louder.

Certainly, I don't mean to offend you. I mean, don't like to split either, but words are designed to divide and that's precisely what I intend to do. To grab your imagination and divide, mimic and taunt the non-sensical derivative bordering your emotional instability which frankly speaking, should not be touched. Let us for a brief moment become savant together, and share these words without any consideration of the consequences which may ensue. Without any doubt in my mind, this book aims to be tactical in its abuse and

### Describe Yourself

So let me try and paint you a picture.

You’re a crispy Ted. Your haircut is an impression-less damp scruff of pastiche antiquity. I’ve never quite seen a suit so brown nor flavourless, and yet you have the confidence to match the dull-drudgery holding you down by your neck. A personality devoid of pleasure. Hell, I doubt even your own irony understands itself. Even what little you bring to the table, but I tell ya what, it’s real cackle to try and observe you attempt to arrange those i’s and o’s into some kind of logical alphabet soup, glisten to an audience privy to the self-abuse you provide. But the good news is that you’re loved. Yes, Mummy loves you. She craves you. Here’s an expired Campbell’s chicken soup she prepared earlier, even opened the can n’ everything. This soup was crafted with real tears, real buttery tears, the kind of tears only found in upper-market department stores and gold-plated Jewish morgues. The kind of soup that burns your throat and slashes your budget into a miserable low-digit summary. Yet Mummy is in a lot of pain, because you made her pussy bleed and now there’s a frail old lady on the floor, mummified in the nostalgia you once thought intangible. There are scars as thick as knife wounds, carved throughout the maze of willingness you expend

A finer touch if ever you demanded one, although as we both know, these words are nothing more than a trap our senses are both trying to fight. “It’s okay to burn”, preaches the local glass nun, shouting vast through these pages without even a hint of respite, white powder thick to her heels in a perfect mirage of gloss and so sheen. Ah yes, and just when you thought life’s searing gaze couldn’t get any worse, a talking Harry presents itself in full-fashion and it just doesn’t know when to stop. Shut up Harry. You violent Harry. Fucking Harry. I was sure she was being tart.

A mature fight-fighter with a body like a well-kept fire axe, covered in the tan ripple of a thoughtless afternoon, fucking your wife by the poolside as you watch by in self-justified shame.

Oh, and it seems that your fetish for Kigurumi men has been egregiously exposed to the world of online, now circulating aggressively to every single data centre across the country under the guise of marketing research. Congenital in its touch. Unrequited in its hold. Wholesome is thy neighbour. Be hound, be told.

I went to the cupboard for a bottle of jock.

And although my heart is currently beating under the false pretense of a meaningful life, all I can say is that the blackmail has become far too much for me to handle and I'd really appreciate it if you'd please PLEASE, for the love of God, just lean over my shoulder and tell me how WONDERFUL my smile is today. Oh, that was lovely. Thank you, Daddy. It's great you could make it. Yes, I love you too.

Melodramatic was the score.

## Scene 3 END
