# How to kill a Chinaman

How to kill a Chinaman is my first novel. It is a collection of stories (based on themed chapters) about a particular character. Each story represents a different situation/phase in this person's life.

The novel doesn't have a narrative per-say. Rather, the character itself is the "narrative" in the sense that it is the subject being developed and understood by the reader.

The intention of the novel is to take you through a provocative theme-park of erotic therapy and extreme trauma. To drop you violently against the floor, crushing your skull in a sudden knockout thud, drifting you beautifully into a state of perpetual coma.

The writing is largely based on the first-person observations and interactions of an unnamed character. The only character which is named is his love interest, Milo.

A delicious free-for-all against the senses.

Character - Cynical Hound.
The Editor - Crazed Yuppie.
Milo - Female Character.

The Neighbour - African, smart, perfect.
The Friend - Weebo Chinese Kid. (Hans)
The Mother - Asian Tiger Parent.
The Helper - Submissive Helper.

# NOTES:

- Assuming that I manage to write 1,000 words a day, I'll be able to have enough words for a novel within 90 days, or perhaps three months. I imagine that's not reasonable, so it will probably take 6 months to produce those words. Within that period, I will also need to edit and refine the story. I imagine that will take probably

- I really need to build up Milo's bipolar personality throughout chapter 2. It's integral to her actions later on in the chapter when he proposes to the main character.

# TODO.

- Find colour note notes and add it here.
- Maybe have a look at some writing on tumblr regarding these events.
- Sign up for a dev account on tumblr, and download all your writing that way. -
- Organise blogspot entries into their own formatted md files.


# IDEAS

- I have a chapter where the character says "Ah, fuck therapy." and that's all the chapter is. If not to simply demonstrate and show the apathy of the character.
- Should the neighbour/neighbourhood chapter (05) explain more about the Chineseness of where I live?
- Give each section a title.


---
title: "neighbour."
description: "The character bumps into his neighbour, who he discovers he has a strong connection with."
day: "Saturday."
---

---
title: "reality."
description: "A chapter where the character expresses his love for Milo. She freaks out. They break up."
day: "Sunday."

Technical aspects:
- Story is well structured.
- Macro is very well structured.
- Writing style itself however, will be hard to edit.
