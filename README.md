# How to kill a Chinaman

How to kill a Chinaman is my first novel. It is a collection of stories (based on themed chapters) about a particular character. Each story represents a different situation/phase in this person's life.

The novel doesn't have a narrative per-say. Rather, the character itself is the "narrative" in the sense that it is the subject being developed and understood by the reader.

The intention of the novel is to take you through a provocatively erotic theme-park of calming therapy and extreme trauma. I want it to drop you violently against the floor, crushing your skull in a sudden knockout thud, as well as drift you beautifully into exciting and fascinating worlds.

The writing is largely based on the first-person observations and interactions of this character.

The character does not have a name.

Editor: Marty
Co-worker: Milo
