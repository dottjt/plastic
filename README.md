# How to kill a Chinaman

How to kill a Chinaman is my first novel. It is a collection of stories (based on themed chapters) about a particular character. Each story represents a different situation/phase in this person's life.

The novel doesn't have a narrative per-say. Rather, the character itself is the "narrative" in the sense that it is the subject being developed and understood by the reader.

The intention of the novel is to take you through a provocative theme-park of erotic therapy and extreme trauma. To drop you violently against the floor, crushing your skull in a sudden knockout thud, drifting you beautifully into a state of perpetual coma.

The writing is largely based on the first-person observations and interactions of an unnamed character. The only character which is named is his love interest, Milo.

Character - Cynical Hound.
The Editor - Crazed Yuppie.
Milo - Female Character
The Boss - Plain Hard-ass.
The Friend - Wee-bo.
The Mother - Tiger Parent.
The Helper -

# NOTES:

Assuming that I manage to write 1,000 words a day, I'll be able to have enough words for a novel within 90 days, or perhaps three months. I imagine that's not reasonable, so it will probably take 6 months to produce those words. Within that period, I will also need to edit and refine the story. I imagine that will take probably
