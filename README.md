# How to kill a Chinaman

How to kill a Chinaman is my first novel. It's a first-person narrative of an unidentified character with severe mental health issues. 

The intention of the novel is to take you through a provocative theme-park of cynicism, violence and mania. I suppose you could describe it as a delicious free-for-all against the senses. Initially it was inspired by William S. Burroughs' novel, Naked Lunch.
