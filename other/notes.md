How can you degrade.

A mentally deranged person.

What is the story that you want to tell?

# Introduction

I once tried to teach a plant to love. Mentally I thought if I could teach a plant to love, that it would somehow prove some kind of innate quality within myself. That I was smart, beautiful and capable of great things. That I was person of empathy and care. Perhaps that I too was deserving of love, although I was happy with

So I created a kind of two-week bootcamp for plants. The idea is that I'd be able to teach them how to love within a two-week period, starting with the basics, such as kissing and complimenting.

In the beginning it didn't go so well. I had no idea what I was doing,






I mean, wouldn't it just be fantastic to come home from a long day's work and have your plants .

Of course, not all plants can learn love.

Some plants are so full of hate that they . Take dafodils for example.





I never particularly liked morals.



someday love me.



I too could one day feel that back.





 Although apparently I wasn't very good at it, since I never actually figured out to get it to cuddle me or tell me how special I am, but






















She could barely hold herself up.

It was a bit like trying to watch a

Dazed and confused. The constant smoking made her veins pretty.

People have a preference of human. We care about the shape of the aparatus which breathes in nose. Itâ€™s in my blood. I cannot control it, but it is me.

# IDEAS

- I have a chapter where the character says "Ah, fuck therapy." and that's all the chapter is. If not to simply demonstrate and show the apathy of the character.
- Should the neighbour/neighbourhood chapter (05) explain more about the Chineseness of where I live?
- Give each section a title.

Technical aspects:
- Story is well structured.
- Macro is very well structured.
- Writing style itself however, will be hard to edit.

# NOTES:

- Assuming that I manage to write 1,000 words a day, I'll be able to have enough words for a novel within 90 days, or perhaps three months. I imagine that's not reasonable, so it will probably take 6 months to produce those words. Within that period, I will also need to edit and refine the story. I imagine that will take probably

- I really need to build up Milo's bipolar personality throughout chapter 2. It's integral to her actions later on in the chapter when he proposes to the main character.

# TODO.

- Find colour note notes and add it here.
- Maybe have a look at some writing on tumblr regarding these events.
