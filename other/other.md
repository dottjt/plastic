dearly hoping it would kill me before rendering me entire paralysed from the waist down.

A floundering point of asymptotic reference, carelessly vague in it's accelerating motion creeping itself into our veins.

Hopelessly devoid of nutritional content, cowering silent in packets of coddled destitution.

In contemporary fashion,

The expectation was vast, ripping itself into the skin and bone of the casual patron,

 within these doors. Those flakey lines of trodden harmony? Were they real? Did they seek pleasure?

Balthazar, Gaspar and Melchior, a commercial success of comical foundry. First you cut the cunt down. Then you leave him bleeding in a flurry of panic and lean excavation.
