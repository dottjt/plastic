24/01/2020 - I've been making good progress on the novel. I've fleshed out what I want the story to be, written a lot more of the chapters and as it turns it, it's basically reciting a lot of my early 20s. I'm struggling to write the later chapters, ultimately because I need to focus solely on finishing the first 7 chapters, because there's a lot of details I haven't yet fleshed out. Really struggling to write today. It's not really coming out, but it's probably because I'm exhausted. 

14/01/2020 - Fleshed out a lot more of the other chapters and topics within the book. Wrote a bit of each. Drew in some writing from Medium. treat. Exported Medium to this repo. Wrote a lot for each chapter. Wrote the stats.sh file

13/01/2020 - Worked on my query letter. I think I know how best to sell it now. Worked on 02-work.md chapter. I must say, I'm exceptionally happy with the first half of chapter one. Still need to rewrite and finish the Chinatown scene. Also fleshed out some of the other chapters that I wanted to write about.

12/01/2020 - Didnâ€™t work on the novel. Took a day off.

11/01/2020 - Spent most of Saturday (today) fleshing out the first chapter and really improving it, especially the Chinatown section.
