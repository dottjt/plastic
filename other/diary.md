19/03/2020 - I had a fantastical dream. I bought a house with Jess. James' friend Aiden bought a house across the road. He hosts a party. Anyway, this girl across the street from the house is african and half chinese. She has a thing for me. She invites me into her apartment and it's covered in Screens. She's stalks me a bit. She wants me, even though I'm already in a relationship. I think she would be an excellent character to add to the book, since it's a little short of characters at the moment. 

18/03/2020 - There have been various highs and lows. The family chapter was hard to write and edit from a technical point of view. It's still not 100% there, but it's relatively closer. Better to come back to it once I have a clearer mind over it. The depression chapter is both writing and editing very quickly. In part because it's not a complex chapter, which has any consequence on the narrative. It merely extrapolates the character and provides context to his life. What he does to cope with it all.

15/03/2020 - Finished most of the 3rd chapter, which is pretty awesome. The book, I think, gets easier the more you write it. I don't think I like the 2nd chapter all that much. It doesn't excite me, nor is it as well written as the 1st. I suppose they can't all be perfect.

11/02/2020 - Certainly, writing a book is no easy feat. It's just a long process, is all. But I guess that's what it's all about. An exhaustion of cavalier.

10/02/2020 - I've tackled most of the 2nd chapter in terms of how I want it edited. It's still a little rough near the end, but that's cool. It is what it is, and I'll be going over it later, certainly. It was a hard slodge, but that's okay. Writing a novel is inevitably a long process. Starting chapter 3, hopefully I can have it completed/edited by the 1st of March. That would be awesome.

01/02/2020 - Finally, I'm back into the swing of it. The Reade is back bby! Making good progress on the book, but more importantly, I've discovered the intent/purpose of the book. I am creating Chinese-counter culture.

29/01/2020 - I'm beginning to get close to finalising the 1st chapter. It's not 100% there yet, but I hope to continue working on it. I've also decided to restructure a lot of the chapters by documenting everything. Although extraneous, it will help tremendously in terms of being able to plan ahead with my writing. I think perahps that's why the first chapter was difficult because I didn't have oversight over the structure of it. I can tell this book has been affecting my mental health. Not because the subject matter, but the task of writing a book. The anxiety of completing it. The feeling of apathy. What ultimately matters is that each step I take towards constructing it, is one step closer towards my goal.

24/01/2020 - I've been making good progress on the novel. I've fleshed out what I want the story to be, written a lot more of the chapters and as it turns it, it's basically reciting a lot of my early 20s. I'm struggling to write the later chapters, ultimately because I need to focus solely on finishing the first 7 chapters, because there's a lot of details I haven't yet fleshed out. Really struggling to write today. It's not really coming out, but it's probably because I'm exhausted.

14/01/2020 - Fleshed out a lot more of the other chapters and topics within the book. Wrote a bit of each. Drew in some writing from Medium. treat. Exported Medium to this repo. Wrote a lot for each chapter. Wrote the stats.sh file

13/01/2020 - Worked on my query letter. I think I know how best to sell it now. Worked on 02-work.md chapter. I must say, I'm exceptionally happy with the first half of chapter one. Still need to rewrite and finish the Chinatown scene. Also fleshed out some of the other chapters that I wanted to write about.

12/01/2020 - Didnâ€™t work on the novel. Took a day off.

11/01/2020 - Spent most of Saturday (today) fleshing out the first chapter and really improving it, especially the Chinatown section.
