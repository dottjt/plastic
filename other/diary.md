10/02/2020 - I've tackled most of the 2nd chapter in terms of how I want it edited. It's still a little rough near the end, but that's cool. It is what it is, and I'll be going over it later, certainly. It was a hard slodge, but that's okay. Writing a novel is inevitably a long process. Starting chapter 3, hopefully I can have it completed/edited by the 1st of March. That would be awesome.

01/02/2020 - Finally, I'm back into the swing of it. The Reade is back bby! Making good progress on the book, but more importantly, I've discovered the intent/purpose of the book. I am creating Chinese-counter culture.

29/01/2020 - I'm beginning to get close to finalising the 1st chapter. It's not 100% there yet, but I hope to continue working on it. I've also decided to restructure a lot of the chapters by documenting everything. Although extraneous, it will help tremendously in terms of being able to plan ahead with my writing. I think perahps that's why the first chapter was difficult because I didn't have oversight over the structure of it. I can tell this book has been affecting my mental health. Not because the subject matter, but the task of writing a book. The anxiety of completing it. The feeling of apathy. What ultimately matters is that each step I take towards constructing it, is one step closer towards my goal.

24/01/2020 - I've been making good progress on the novel. I've fleshed out what I want the story to be, written a lot more of the chapters and as it turns it, it's basically reciting a lot of my early 20s. I'm struggling to write the later chapters, ultimately because I need to focus solely on finishing the first 7 chapters, because there's a lot of details I haven't yet fleshed out. Really struggling to write today. It's not really coming out, but it's probably because I'm exhausted.

14/01/2020 - Fleshed out a lot more of the other chapters and topics within the book. Wrote a bit of each. Drew in some writing from Medium. treat. Exported Medium to this repo. Wrote a lot for each chapter. Wrote the stats.sh file

13/01/2020 - Worked on my query letter. I think I know how best to sell it now. Worked on 02-work.md chapter. I must say, I'm exceptionally happy with the first half of chapter one. Still need to rewrite and finish the Chinatown scene. Also fleshed out some of the other chapters that I wanted to write about.

12/01/2020 - Didnâ€™t work on the novel. Took a day off.

11/01/2020 - Spent most of Saturday (today) fleshing out the first chapter and really improving it, especially the Chinatown section.
