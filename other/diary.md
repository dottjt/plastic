14/01/2020 - Fleshed out a lot more of the other chapters and topics within the book. Wrote a bit of each. Drew in some writing from Medium. treat. Exported Medium to this repo. Wrote a lot for each chapter. Wrote the stats.sh file

13/01/2020 - Worked on my query letter. I think I know how best to sell it now. Worked on 02-work.md chapter. I must say, I'm exceptionally happy with the first half of chapter one. Still need to rewrite and finish the Chinatown scene. Also fleshed out some of the other chapters that I wanted to write about.

12/01/2020 - Didnâ€™t work on the novel. Took a day off.

11/01/2020 - Spent most of Saturday (today) fleshing out the first chapter and really improving it, especially the Chinatown section.
