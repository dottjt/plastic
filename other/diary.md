26/03/2020 - I've been focusing on my mental and physical health and I believe I am back on track with this novel. 

23/03/2020 - The book has definitely become a struggle at this point. Perhaps because we're all permanently stuck at home due to the coronavirus. Working from home is kinda killing me in terms of routine, because I would write the book on the train into work, as well as back from work. Regardless, I'll get through it. Also hasn't helped that my mental health hasn't been great, but that's okay too. At least attempting to work on it at all is good. I'm slowly coming back down from the hysteria. I've stopped reading the news and that's helped a lot. Especially in terms of regaining my focus.

21/03/2020 - Making nice casual progress on the book. Doing my bit each day. I think I've definitely become a lot less worried about, and focusing on the process of enjoying writing it and just ensuring that I have a high quality book at the end of the day. I have no idea how long it will take realistically, but that's okay too! I've also really, really been getting into working out, so I have other ambitions as well which I find awesome. Lifting six days a week.

Also, it's worth stating that the stock market crash has nothing to do with the coronavirus. That was written well-before the pandemic.

11/03/2020 - I've been sidetracked from writing my novel. I've been busy with sorting out this new gaming pc that I'm buying for my partner, as well as figuring out which monitor to get, which has been mentally draining. With that said, chapter 4 is complete and I'm half-way through chapter 5 - .

21/02/2020 - I had the weirdest dream last night. But essentially I was at a Chinese nightclub. And essentially what it ended up being was a massive brothel, and that's what they considered to be

20/02/2020 - Been writing a lot more of the overarching story and figuring out how best to draw out the story, which has been great, because it gives the story a lot more depth. It also fills out a lot of the other pages. I probably have a good 40,000k worth of words planned, although not sure how to end the story yet. Especially how I deal with the neighbour, and my mother. Perhaps she dies in the end, we'll see. We'll see how we want the character to suffer lel.

19/02/2020 - I had a fantastical dream. I bought a house with Jess. James' friend Aiden bought a house across the road. He hosts a party. Anyway, this girl across the street from the house is african and half chinese. She has a thing for me. She invites me into her apartment and it's covered in Screens. She's stalks me a bit. She wants me, even though I'm already in a relationship. I think she would be an excellent character to add to the book, since it's a little short of characters at the moment. Made huge changes to the structure of the novel. I think it will work well. Very well.

18/02/2020 - There have been various highs and lows. The family chapter was hard to write and edit from a technical point of view. It's still not 100% there, but it's relatively closer. Better to come back to it once I have a clearer mind over it. The depression chapter is both writing and editing very quickly. In part because it's not a complex chapter, which has any consequence on the narrative. It merely extrapolates the character and provides context to his life. What he does to cope with it all.

15/02/2020 - Finished most of the 3rd chapter, which is pretty awesome. The book, I think, gets easier the more you write it. I don't think I like the 2nd chapter all that much. It doesn't excite me, nor is it as well written as the 1st. I suppose they can't all be perfect.

11/02/2020 - Certainly, writing a book is no easy feat. It's just a long process, is all. But I guess that's what it's all about. An exhaustion of cavalier.

10/02/2020 - I've tackled most of the 2nd chapter in terms of how I want it edited. It's still a little rough near the end, but that's cool. It is what it is, and I'll be going over it later, certainly. It was a hard slodge, but that's okay. Writing a novel is inevitably a long process. Starting chapter 3, hopefully I can have it completed/edited by the 1st of March. That would be awesome.

01/02/2020 - Finally, I'm back into the swing of it. The Reade is back bby! Making good progress on the book, but more importantly, I've discovered the intent/purpose of the book. I am creating Chinese-counter culture.

29/01/2020 - I'm beginning to get close to finalising the 1st chapter. It's not 100% there yet, but I hope to continue working on it. I've also decided to restructure a lot of the chapters by documenting everything. Although extraneous, it will help tremendously in terms of being able to plan ahead with my writing. I think perahps that's why the first chapter was difficult because I didn't have oversight over the structure of it. I can tell this book has been affecting my mental health. Not because the subject matter, but the task of writing a book. The anxiety of completing it. The feeling of apathy. What ultimately matters is that each step I take towards constructing it, is one step closer towards my goal.

24/01/2020 - I've been making good progress on the novel. I've fleshed out what I want the story to be, written a lot more of the chapters and as it turns it, it's basically reciting a lot of my early 20s. I'm struggling to write the later chapters, ultimately because I need to focus solely on finishing the first 7 chapters, because there's a lot of details I haven't yet fleshed out. Really struggling to write today. It's not really coming out, but it's probably because I'm exhausted.

14/01/2020 - Fleshed out a lot more of the other chapters and topics within the book. Wrote a bit of each. Drew in some writing from Medium. treat. Exported Medium to this repo. Wrote a lot for each chapter. Wrote the stats.sh file

13/01/2020 - Worked on my query letter. I think I know how best to sell it now. Worked on 02-work.md chapter. I must say, I'm exceptionally happy with the first half of chapter one. Still need to rewrite and finish the Chinatown scene. Also fleshed out some of the other chapters that I wanted to write about.

12/01/2020 - Didnâ€™t work on the novel. Took a day off.

11/01/2020 - Spent most of Saturday (today) fleshing out the first chapter and really improving it, especially the Chinatown section.
