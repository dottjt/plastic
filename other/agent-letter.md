# query letter.

Dear ,

My name is Julius Reade. I am 27 years old. I am an unpublished author.

My novel is entitled “How to kill a Chinaman”. It is a novel about the thoughts and observations of an unnamed character, based loosely on my own life experiences. It aims to be a contemporary discovery of modern day ethnicity, mired in cynicism, dark humour and challenging taboos. It is R-rated.

The main narrative revolves around his love interest, Milo (the only named character within the novel), and his descent into madness. It touches all themes of life, from love, misfortune, disparity to addiction. Ultimately however, the main draw of the novel is in it’s writing style. I imagine that the core audience for this book care more for the delivery and intrigue of the words, as opposed to the over-arching structure of the story, as it’s lyrical pool draws you in to this broken world of complexity and degradation.

I have put no commercial consideration into the novel. My sole intention was to produce the best possible novel that my particular writing style could produce, and I believe I have hit that mark. It is something that I would whole-heartedly want to read, that I found lacking in the current, contemporary book market.

My inspirations are William S. Burroughs.

Regards,

Julius
