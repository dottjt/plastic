you could sense his mind falter at the pseudo-salad slosh of defective commentary his mouth felt compelled to reveal.

"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room as he swivels his chair towards my general direction. Hesitant in a gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, you could sense his mind falter at the pseudo-salad slosh of defective commentary his mouth felt compelled to reveal. Struck brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares, only crumbs were left of the star-mangled biscuits. Presumably store-bought for our excited listeners at home. Dwadling frantic on a notepad fit suitably for a 90s' Nickelodeon pre-teen, he was the mindless operator who would introduce himself as my only lifeline into the world of publishing, and I was the pathetic liar who intended to milk his acquaintance for all it was worth.

Only to be complemented by the corduous stench which leaked from the mangled pipes from within the ceiling above. A welcome blessing to the establishment of fine-dine publishing, thankfully contained within the four walls of this room. The curse and downfall of a 70s' decor filled to the brim with unwashed tupperware and plastic varnish, tainted by a sickly yellow synthesis oozing itself from the congregation of fake Tulips situated to the north of the perimeter, coalescing in satanic droves into the decrepit atmosphere of the dimly lit room. All while providing just enough grim to keep the magic of creativity from harming the integrity of publishing itself.

muttered the editor mid prawn-cracker, as he threw his menu onto the table beside him. Completely unaware that I had yet to order anything from Mr. Ming's consortium of unidentified protein eschew.

"Well editor, I can call you that, right? I suppose I would describe it as story which takes you through the thoughts and interactions of a character who violently degrades to a point of complete destitution," I answered, ready to endure a concise refraction of meaningless assault.

"That sounds a lot like fantasy to me. You know I don't do fantasy, right? I'm personally all about the human story. Can you come back to me with that?"

If only I had a gun and an incessant desire to kill Italians, then we could end this scene in a wok full of limbs and cheap hair gel. At this point I was equally as hungry as I was keen to have him tied to a bench and water tortured, although realising my cake had already been spat on, trampled and fucked on, it was clear I'd already delegated my mind to the misery module located conveniently via in a PCI slot in my skull. A dozy appetite suppressant, now programmed to endure whatever existing attrition was being held against my soul.

I mean, can you even taste the salt in the air? It's everywhere. In my eyes. My lungs, oh those poor little lungs of mine. It's a bit like trying to breathe without the glamour of knowing where exactly the oxygen is coming from. Perhaps that's just how we do it here in Cattle Country, remise to the steak you gorge on and hoard. An excellent place to adore, as well as ignore, all kinds of pertinent squalor; the same kind you so profess as professional gold. Your rough heart creates many.

We would then create the ultimate safari experience, allowing you to kill, maim or disturb as many innocent animals as you fit please, as long as the barrel of your gun is large enough to wipe it out in one shot. I'm sure the funding will come in soon.

# Preface

You may want to skip this preface.

In part, because it explains the true intention of this book, which may either ruin the delivery and charm of these words, or perhaps enhance them to an extent of acceptance. I personally would argue that the outward misunderstanding I present forms a large part of the identity of this book, and so knowing less may in fact be desirable depending on your taste for the unpronounced.

There are a few themes in this book which I’ve been personally fascinated with for a very long time, largely due to life’s circumstances which I’ve always felt compelled to write about. And I think in introducing these themes to you, that humble reader with a fantastic smile, I believe you may gain a greater understanding of what exactly it is I’m trying to convey here.

The first and perhaps more predominant theme is that of artificialness. It’s a core theme in my life which I feel like I’ve had to manage to a large extent, whether that be with my own feelings towards life or the conditioning that sees us become mentally ill in the pursuit of lifelong tenure.

The second theme is that of degradation, guilt and self-harm. I feel that a lot of life is expressed in these terms to an extent which is often out of our control,

Although I maintain a high level of self-respect, no longer bridled in addiction or self-harm (the latter is questionable) the point is that there is no possible way I could have written an entire book if it weren’t for this
