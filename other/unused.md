A floundering point of asymptotic reference, carelessly vague in it's accelerating motion creeping itself into our veins.

at the clamature of the situation
In contemporary fashion,
followed by a unwitting gasp at the clamature of the situation,

The expectation was vast, ripping itself into the skin and bone of the casual patron,

 within these doors. Those flakey lines of trodden harmony? Were they real? Did they seek pleasure?

Balthazar, Gaspar and Melchior, a commercial success of comical foundry. First you cut the cunt down. Then you leave him bleeding in a flurry of panic and lean excavation. Then you crepe your victim via a most beautiful method of distortion, taught only by seventh century con-artists and those with a phonetic tradition to lie.

I mean, can you even taste the salt in the air? It's everywhere. In my eyes. My lungs, oh those poor little lungs of mine. It's a bit like trying to breathe without the glamour of knowing where exactly the oxygen is coming from. Perhaps that's just how we do it here in Cattle Country, remise to the steak you gorge on and hoard. An excellent place to adore, as well as ignore, all kinds of pertinent squalor; the same kind you so profess as professional gold. Your rough heart creates many.

An exciting state of explicit premonition, as your father dies in front of you with a face of sordid bloodiness, and then again in full motion as re-enacted by a man in green suit to be retrofitted to a scene in Top Gun.

We would then create the ultimate safari experience, allowing you to kill, maim or disturb as many innocent animals as you fit please, as long as the barrel of your gun is large enough to wipe it out in one shot. I'm sure the funding will come in soon.

# Preface

You may want to skip this preface.

In part, because it explains the true intention of this book, which may either ruin the delivery and charm of these words, or perhaps enhance them to an extent of acceptance. I personally would argue that the outward misunderstanding I present forms a large part of the identity of this book, and so knowing less may in fact be desirable depending on your taste for the unpronounced.

There are a few themes in this book which I’ve been personally fascinated with for a very long time, largely due to life’s circumstances which I’ve always felt compelled to write about. And I think in introducing these themes to you, that humble reader with a fantastic smile, I believe you may gain a greater understanding of what exactly it is I’m trying to convey here.

The first and perhaps more predominant theme is that of artificialness. It’s a core theme in my life which I feel like I’ve had to manage to a large extent, whether that be with my own feelings towards life or the conditioning that sees us become mentally ill in the pursuit of lifelong tenure.

The second theme is that of degradation, guilt and self-harm. I feel that a lot of life is expressed in these terms to an extent which is often out of our control,

Although I maintain a high level of self-respect, no longer bridled in addiction or self-harm (the latter is questionable) the point is that there is no possible way I could have written an entire book if it weren’t for this
