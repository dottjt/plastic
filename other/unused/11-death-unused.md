In reality, I could barely breathe.

. Which is why I decided to create you. A man who at the very least, has a great taste in words. Isn't that right? Because words are fun, and who doesn't want to have fun.


I suppose I felt like writing to you today, so I could let you know how much you actually mean to me. To bring you to life. To see you smile. Of course, I already spend most of my free time writing, so it's a big deal or anything. Except maybe it is a big deal.


 and it's something I really enjoy doing. Hopefully enough to inspire others to write, although I'm not sure if that's such a good idea. You might even call me a writer, not that I do it for a living. It's just something that helps me feel a little more ...connected with myself.

 only that I'm struggling to truly feel who I am. I used to be okay at feeling. It was something I did without too much thought, but today I find myself in disrepair. Unable to feel in any capacity at all. I wish things were different, but I'm unable to

 Which means I created you. I created you, because I have great taste in words. Isn't that right? Yeah, I think so too. Words are fun because they help me understand the world a little bit better. Words are friends, because they . Don't you love how the curves around the . I love the way you hold me.

So excuse me if that's the case, but you're not quite like the others. You're different, and I like that. Even the way your eyes blink. There's a certain beauty to that. I think we'll get along.

Like most uncouth, tabs had become a regular fact of life. Ego refreshers. They helped break down absolutely everything you knew about yourself into useless piles of silt. Just fine enough that you couldn't quite hold it within your hands, but solid enough that you could see it with your own eyes. The key was to take em' once every two weeks, otherwise you'd end up messing with your tolerance. With something like LSD you could probably get away with takin' em' once every week, although LSD was nowhere near as strong as the research chemicals I was digesting. They were significantly cheaper, nearly 10 times as strong and they packed a punch which left you completely incapacitated in the most euphoric of ways. They were a variant of nBome. 25i-nBome. The strongest and most visual of the nBome compounds.

Thankfully the tabs were nothing like the seeds. You'd have to perform an alcohol extraction on them. I personally used methylated spirits, which more-or-less was pure ethanol, minus some compounds which were placed inside it to make you want to purge yourself. Some methylated spirits actually contain compounds which make you go blind. Thankfully I called the manufacturer and they confirmed that it was fully safe. They must have known that I was up to something.
