Milk. Acquaintance. He licks his lips with a sickening kvetch. Botch n' bauble. Sordidly numb. My eyes quiver in hopeless anticipation upon the defective commentary I'd come to endure over the past hour and a half.

Most assuredly, the rent was strong in this one, and so too was the fallacy in mine.

"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room as he swivels his chair towards my general direction. Hesitant in a gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, you could sense his mind falter at the pseudo-salad slosh of defective commentary his mouth felt compelled to reveal. Struck brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares, only crumbs were left of the star-mangled biscuits. Presumably store-bought for our excited listeners at home. Dwadling frantic on a notepad fit suitably for a 90s' Nickelodeon pre-teen, he was the mindless operator who would introduce himself as my only lifeline into the world of publishing, and I was the pathetic liar who intended to milk his acquaintance for all it was worth.

muttered the editor mid prawn-cracker, as he threw his menu onto the table beside him. Completely unaware that I had yet to order anything from Mr. Ming's consortium of unidentified protein eschew.

"Well editor, I can call you that, right? I suppose I would describe it as story which takes you through the thoughts and interactions of a character who violently degrades to a point of complete destitution," I answered, ready to endure a concise refraction of meaningless assault.

"That sounds a lot like fantasy to me. You know I don't do fantasy, right? I'm personally all about the human story. Can you come back to me with that?"

If only I had a gun and an incessant desire to kill Italians, then we could end this scene in a wok full of limbs and cheap hair gel. At this point I was equally as hungry as I was keen to have him tied to a bench and water tortured, although realising my cake had already been spat on, trampled and fucked, it was clear I'd already delegated my mind to the misery module located conveniently via in a PCI slot in my skull. A dozy appetite suppressant, now programmed to endure whatever existing attrition was being held against my soul.

Perhaps for the first time in his life, the editor didn't quite know how to respond. No answer to the looming divorce of thy union. No conceivable way to writhe his way back into pole position. No method to express how little control he had over the situation. No loophole to charm or linger. No words or audience to please. He was an irrelevant puddle of defeat, and I made sure to let him know of his stature in the crinkle slade of disappointment I displayed on my face, as I lifted myself up from the table and walked away.
