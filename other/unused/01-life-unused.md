"Truly fantastic", the editor announces from across the room as he swivels his chair towards my general direction. Hesitant in a gleam of cheap cologne and uncompromising flattery, you could sense his mind falter at the pseudo-salad slosh of defective commentary his mouth felt compelled to reveal. Struck brazen in a dyslexic haze of powdered aspartame and lopsided cheese squares, only crumbs were left of the star-mangled biscuits. Presumably store-bought for our excited listeners at home. Dwadling frantic on a notepad fit suitably for a 90s' Nickelodeon pre-teen, he was the mindless operator who would introduce himself as my only lifeline into the world of publishing, and I was the pathetic liar who intended to milk his acquaintance for all it was worth.

At one point, I was convinced he was trying to sell me a phone plan, subtle in the dubious hints of unintelligible sign language his fingers deliberated in submissive resolution. Outweighing all logical possibility,

Only to be complemented by the corduous stench which leaked from the mangled pipes from within the ceiling above. A welcome blessing to the establishment of fine-dine publishing, thankfully contained within the four walls of this room.

<!-- The curse and downfall of a 70s' decor filled to the brim with unwashed tupperware and plastic varnish, tainted by a sickly yellow synthesis oozing itself from the congregation of fake Tulips situated to the north of the perimeter, coalescing in satanic droves into the decrepit atmosphere of the dimly lit room. All while providing just enough grim to keep the magic of creativity from harming the integrity of publishing itself. -->

"Well editor, I can call you that, right? I suppose I would describe it as story which takes you through the thoughts and interactions of a character who violently degrades to a point of complete destitution," I answered, ready to endure a concise refraction of meaningless assault.

"That sounds a lot like fantasy to me. You know I don't do fantasy, right? I'm personally all about the human story. Can you come back to me with that?"

If only I had a gun and an incessant desire to kill Italians, then we could end this scene in a wok full of limbs and cheap hair gel. At this point I was equally as hungry as I was keen to have him tied to a bench and water tortured, although realising my cake had already been spat on, trampled and fucked on, it was clear I'd already delegated my mind to the misery module located conveniently via in a PCI slot in my skull. A dozy appetite suppressant, now programmed to endure whatever existing attrition was being held against my soul.

Surely it was abnormal to confuse verbal harassment with the extravagant excellence of five-star customer service, as an ode to the millions of telemarkers makin' dime sellin' faulty car insurance to reckless youth with a mandatory requirement for debt spending.
