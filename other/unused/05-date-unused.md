"Very funny," I noted in extreme caution, knowing full-well that there was a 1 in 10 chance that her flirtatious actions could result in a round of heated bathroom sex, unfortunate for the disabled sod in a 60s' wheel chair holding on for dear life to the ambient noise of sexual wear n' tear.

I was the world's smallest priest, attempting to preach justice upon this woman's biggest nightmare. A stable relationship, along with a hearty tick of monogamy.

I place my tongue around my neck, embracing the flavoured tinnitus pouring from the uncalculated madness of her words.

 Wrought in a silk cloth of god-fearing shyness.
