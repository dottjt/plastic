A profane blather of fibre-optic lunacy.
The uponcorrupted in my phonetic heart.

profane dreaded lunacy

lunacy

profane finesse

The paraxial of thy gracious word, dragging it's phonetic heart miserably along a serrated tarmac of profane finesse.

dragging rapine imposture miserably

Dead. Dead. Dead. Like the Dead

circular modesty and

friday's mistake.

to the foreboding impasse


Breasts are held. Champagne is sauntered .



Although in keeping relevant with my response to the foreboding impasse, I simply yawned at the thought, testament to the brute resilience forcing it's way through the impenetrable perception I had of myself as the fucking Queen.

The textile green of cannabis made everything better again. The universal craving without a suitable name. Yeah. That's what I needed.

A gluttony of fortuitous misdirection, contrary to the literary creation embracing the coarse writing on these walls.
