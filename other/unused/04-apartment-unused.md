A profane blather of fibre-optic lunacy.

A profane blather of fibre-optic lunacy.
The uponcorrupted in my phonetic heart.

profane dreaded lunacy

lunacy

profane finesse

The paraxial of thy gracious word, dragging it's phonetic heart miserably along a serrated tarmac of profane finesse.

dragging rapine imposture miserably

Dead. Dead. Dead. Like the Dead

circular modesty and

friday's mistake.

to the foreboding impasse


Breasts are held. Champagne is sauntered .



Although in keeping relevant with my response to the foreboding impasse, I simply yawned at the thought, testament to the brute resilience forcing it's way through the impenetrable perception I had of myself as the fucking Queen.

"It only comes once every two years, so unless if you're willing to choo, choo, choo - you better know your place, or be culled." 

To serve and teach the foundations of life itself.

Enthralled in confusion.

A tidal disowning

swallowed valiant in whole

the seminal texts of

Throbbing in a quaint requiem of on-going misery,

, engaging in a visicious civil war of pretend.

A bloody triangle of equal equivalence,

Perhaps I was the abuse, in my quest to express

drown my voice out

. Where in a sudden snap of attention, I decide to embark my riches

 in my glass

 with the vast sea of wine in my glass

 I was just another one of Friday's mistake.
Friday's mistake.

trampling my ability to amend,

my star-studded torso with the actions of my past,

that it probably deserved it's own title in this championship of cremation.

 Some would say, alive.



Sometimes, it felt as if I granted myself permission to be an awful person. To express how little I could care as a human being, in .   The hurt which shoved it's precious little fingers into my pie and left me vomitting all over myself in an episode of gastro.

 Perhaps I was the abuse, in my quest to kill hope.

I had become a self-righteous donkey and this was how I expressed my pretend.

 a wholesome sight for my kidneys

All I knew was that the energy which did remain in the aftermath of my disarray, was barely enough to compute what little posture I'd hoped to maintain.

The textile green of cannabis made everything better again. The universal craving without a suitable name. Yeah. That's what I needed.

A gluttony of fortuitous misdirection, contrary to the literary creation embracing the coarse writing on these walls.

A protruing lump.

Aside from my date with Milo, I was unsure what I was going to do today.




A protruding lump.

A Fluoxetine high without the hypnotic mirth.





, inspite of clearly offering more than just a rag of sincere physical extrapolation. I mean, I was wearing .

my confirmation of God's existence. Basking in

like a lollygag of harmless spiders pouring from a busted sac of deflated extradition. Tickling their prey into a folly of flawless submission.

She proceeded to open her apartment door with a chain of keys,

the squirmy love-hen bullshit


fiddler

A bloated contradiction of soft pale flesh and popcorn

 for the way life treated her. Those certainly weren't designer lips.

 Not quite old enough to be retired, yet nowhere near fulfilling any sort of niche to become a cam girl. Her occupation was a mystery to all.

 and  revealed itself to the mainstay discourse of my mind.

 Projector's everywhere. Screens of all different kinds.

 , shoving my foot in her asshole and hearing her scream

 Even the cups in the kitchen were made from old makeup table show-lights, brittle in their dark phosphorus gleam of sexual abuse and mafia intimidation.

 Apparently if a girl looks at your lips three times it means she wants to kiss you, and I was certain that she wanted my tongue. Of course, we were neighbours and I was about as self-assured as a wet sock. But at least I was honest with myself.

 I suppose I couldn't have both women cavort my lap, rubbing my pre-cum into the flouncing creases of my pants.

I was enjoying myself so much that I'd forgotten

Although maybe she preferred the drug-fucked look of a man covered in the scent of a poorly received six-pack, now wreaking havoc with the odour of his shirt some many weeks later.

I wasn't sure if what I said came across as being needy, however it was genuinely how I felt.

as I left her apartment in a giddy of infatuation



I receive another text from Milo. This time an image. Transparent red lace. Trim embellish. Pure white skin. An exercise of pre-cum on this Sunday afternoon.


 As beautiful as beauty could be.
