Mornin' coffee. Mornin' wank. Mornin' grain.

the fabled black problem.

an event which had spawned an all-out war between my brain and my stomach.

Margarine's tainted folly digs it's five-inch heels firmly into your hardened arteries, as you attempt to pry the concrete from your eyes with a miniature pickaxe at 5:20am in the morning.

Margarine's tainted folly of hardened bliss.

Mesmerisingly subterranean,

It was too bad she knew nothing of my obsession, shrouded in the ripped veil of velvet rouge, only for my imagination to see. I dearly hoped she felt the same of me, although I knew it was wishful thinking.

Well, it was more of an immediate obsession than it was a simple acknowledgement to be upheld.

North vs South in a diluted battle of makeshift terms, fuzzy in the lack of genuine discourse being discussed amongst the various allies of tongue and cheek.

, given it was past lunch time and I'd decided not to even bother showing up to work to begin with. Especially since I knew my boss was going to be away, if not out of chance, just like he'd been for most of my child and adult life. Maybe that explained my erratic behaviour and desperate attention-seeking prowess, the proud legacy of professional neglect and ineffective HR practice. Obviously, my options were limited to the pocket-sized grain of rationality that hadn't yet been completed consumed by the creeping anxiety of being fired in some dramatic shootout in the carpark, so I had to think fast.

This week's perfect solution to the rampant "black" problem.

I mean, can you even taste the salt in the air? It's everywhere. In my eyes. My lungs, oh those poor little lungs of mine. It's a bit like trying to breathe without the glamour of knowing where exactly the oxygen is coming from. Perhaps that's just how we do it here in Cattle Country, remise to the steak you gorge on and hoard. An excellent place to adore, as well as ignore, all kinds of pertinent squalor; the same kind you so profess as professional gold. Your rough heart creates many.

We would then create the ultimate safari experience, allowing you to kill, maim or disturb as many innocent animals as you fit please, as long as the barrel of your gun is large enough to wipe it out in one shot. I'm sure the funding will come in soon.

drenched in a cake of warm semen and indecent sweat. Mortal indecency sopping in the crimes of a sex-offender.

I was a creep and a saboteur, and there was little I could do about it.

Rhetoric aside, I actually quite like work. THANK YOU, EMPLOYEE #545. And aside from literally being paid by the hour to make this company-wide announcement, I genuinely think it's a perfect package of routine and marriage. A fat bitch with rolls of potato gravy arrives at your trailer for a quick fuck, lipped with a ciggie that mostly consisted of ash and christened wallpaper, gunt the size of a pregnant gorilla, comes right on over .

No one wants to swipe right on the weird looking pervert licking his lips feverously at the sight of a bucket of chicken.

At least in my mind, every romance was a mirage. I suspected most women were suspicious of Chinese men. Filthy chinks with a cushy for refined shirmp paste.
