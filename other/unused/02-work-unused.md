It was too bad she knew nothing of my obsession, shrouded in the ripped veil of velvet rouge, only for my imagination to see. I dearly hoped she felt the same of me, although I knew it was wishful thinking.

Well, it was more of an immediate obsession than it was a simple acknowledgement to be upheld.

Hoping she would reach out and take my hand, whilst pathologically pretending to be my girlfriend in front of fellow co-workers. There wasn't a single thing I could fault.

What categorised Milo, aside from my ardent obsession with her existence, was that she was a bit of a bipolar baby.


, given it was past lunch time and I'd decided not to even bother showing up to work to begin with. Especially since I knew my boss was going to be away, if not out of chance, just like he'd been for most of my child and adult life. Maybe that explained my erratic behaviour and desperate attention-seeking prowess, the proud legacy of professional neglect and ineffective HR practice. Obviously, my options were limited to the pocket-sized grain of rationality that hadn't yet been completed consumed by the creeping anxiety of being fired in some dramatic shootout in the carpark, so I had to think fast.

I mean, can you even taste the salt in the air? It's everywhere. In my eyes. My lungs, oh those poor little lungs of mine. It's a bit like trying to breathe without the glamour of knowing where exactly the oxygen is coming from. Perhaps that's just how we do it here in Cattle Country, remise to the steak you gorge on and hoard. An excellent place to adore, as well as ignore, all kinds of pertinent squalor; the same kind you so profess as professional gold. Your rough heart creates many.

The orange-backs maintained the Machine of Profit™. They were hardened loyalists with an obsessive personality, fanatic in their pursuit for operational perfection. They documented, studied and lauded over every single aspect of the Machine of Profit™ in an entire library full of arcane functions. Tested and praised for their striking simulation of reality. They were thrifty scavengers with a gifted sense of time, known to survive for weeks on end without nourishment, readied in travelled groves to suckle the moisture from their weary foes. An ability which allowed them to work for days on end without even a puddle of coy to contrive. An introverted cog of divine certification and befuddled self-esteem, they where the ultimate servants to the establishment, vaticinal in their ability to optimise even the most basic of algorithms. Lead by a pale autistic child who bore tiny little keyboards for fingers, the child went as far as to have his frail body fused into the Machine of Profit™ itself, dependent upon it's operation for his survival. Known to orange-backs as the Son of Machine™.

The blue-backs on the other hand were the very source of the Machine of Profit™ itself. Privileged emissaries whom kept it's precious profits flowing in a ritual sacrifice known as the accordance. At the precise dot of every hour, two blue-backs would be chosen from the chantry by the High Priest of Profit™, to have their wrists simultaneously slit on a bright ivory carpet to provide margin to the ever-growing profit flowing from the machine's glowing aura of surfeit. Their naked bodies, stripped of all necessity and rubbed with a diamond cordite, were to be fed into the machine and mashed into a viscous chenille collagen, stamped and compressed to form company credits. A beautiful death in the eyes of the communion, it was the sole duty of the blue-back to churn and be churned; their cheer awash with the twady vigour which kept their faces in deep attention with the profit which made them whole.

Well, at least a fraction of this would hold true if the dreaded excess of work didn't also lead to an almost debilitating level of self-harm, now manifesting itself into a compulsive desire to gouge your own bladder out with a disposable plastic spoon, left ever-so keenly in the office kitchen for such prying eyes to declare. A symbol of millennial martyr in thy duty of unreasonable stress, delegated ever-so softly as a personality disorder with just the right amount of sparkle n' jazz to keep the leadership in a-buzz.
