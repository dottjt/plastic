A profane blather of fibre-optic lunacy.

coddled destitution

Romeo lunacy

fibre-optic circularity

circular needles

A profane blather of fibre-optic lunacy.
The uponcorrupted in my phonetic heart.

circular needles

profane dreaded lunacy

lunacy

profane finesse

The paraxial of thy gracious word, dragging it's phonetic heart miserably along a serrated tarmac of profane finesse.

dragging rapine imposture miserably

Dead. Dead. Dead. Like the Dead

circular needles

circular modesty and

friday's mistake.

to the foreboding impasse


Breasts are held. Champange is saundered.



Although in keeping relevant with my response to the foreboding impasse, I simply yawned at the thought, testament to the brute resilience forcing it's way through the impenetrable perception I had of myself as the fucking Queen.

"It only comes once every two years, so unless if you're willing to choo, choo, choo - you better know your place, or be culled." 

To serve and teach the foundations of life itself.

Enthralled in confusion.

A tidal disowning

swallowed valiant in whole

the seminal texts of

Throbbing in a quaint requiem of on-going misery,

, engaging in a visicious civil war of pretend.

A bloody triangle of equal equivalence,

Perhaps I was the abuse, in my quest to express

drown my voice out

. Where in a sudden snap of attention, I decide to embark my riches

 in my glass

 with the vast sea of wine in my glass

 I was just another one of Friday's mistake.
Friday's mistake.

trampling my ability to amend,

my star-studded torso with the actions of my past,

that it probably deserved it's own title in this championship of cremation.

 Some would say, alive.



Sometimes, it felt as if I granted myself permission to be an awful person. To express how little I could care as a human being, in .   The hurt which shoved it's precious little fingers into my pie and left me vomitting all over myself in an episode of gastro.

 Perhaps I was the abuse, in my quest to kill hope.

I had become a self-righteous donkey and this was how I expressed my pretend.
