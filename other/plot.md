# plot

## life. Chapter 1 - Friday
It's midday Friday. The story begins with the main character's meeting with an editor. The character is looking to get his book published. We learn a lot about the character's personality. They eventually head to Chinatown for lunch, at a restaurant called The Ming. The character describes the derelict of Chinatown, as well as the poor conditions of the restaurant. They end up fighting over their irreconcilable differences, and the character decides to leave.

## work. Chapter 2 - Friday
The character still has to return to work. Arriving at the work building, he notices he's misplaced his work pass, which is when he bumps into his co-worker, Milo. She has severe bipolar disorder, and he has a massive crush on her. She is indifferent to him. He provides descriptions of the workplace. Eventually, he joins Milo for a cigarette which leads her to asking him out on a date. Although elated, he feels conflicted, because it didn't feel genuine. Perhaps, it was an episode of mania.

## family. Chapter 3 - Friday
Work has finished, and he is taking the train to his mother's house for dinner. He describes the splendor of the rich Chinese suburbs. He then describes his upbringing and the issues he has with porn. We also briefly meet my mother's helper. He describes his hate for his mother. At a certain point, he decides that he's had enough of her, and decides to disown her. She sends him a text. He heads back home, breaking down into tears.

## depression. Chapter 4 - Saturday
He wakes up the next day in a slump of depression. His usual Saturday funk. He elaborates on his depression, as well as the guilt he feels for how he acted towards his mother. He goes and smokes weed, like he usually does on weekends. He simply doesn't care.

## neighbour. Chapter 5 - Saturday
It's midday. He decides to leave the apartment for some fresh air, where he bumps into a neighbour and decides to help them out. The neighbour turns out to be a gorgeous African lady who's obsessed with film and cinema. Her name is Maria. She is kind and stable. They appear like-minded and right for each other. He enters her apartment and they get to know each other. He recieves a text from Milo, and leaves for his date with Milo.

## date. Chapter 6 - Saturday
Later in the afternoon, he heads out to her apartment. She's not quite right. Possibly on drugs. The head out. The engage with activities. (Still not sure what they actually do). They come back to his place. They have sex. He'd can't orgasm.

## reality. Chapter 7 - Sunday

## therapy. 8 - Sunday
The character attends his weekly therapy session. He discusses some of the events of the past week. He doesn't like the therapist. He's too cynical. It just makes him more depressed and hopeless. He's feeling a little reckless. Just over it all. Thinks it will make him look cool, but is also suicidal and indifferent to what happens regardless.

## gun. Chapter 9 - Sunday
The character does his weekly shop. He describes his shopping experience. He bumps into his neighbour. Asks if she wants to hang out on his birthday. On the way back home, he decides to purchase a gun. He's feeling indifferent to the whole thing.

## bubble. Chapter 11 - Monday

## One month passes

## death. Chapter 12 - Wednesday
We are one month into the future and the character still has no job. He's even more helpless. He's devolved. He decides to take a tab. He meets up with a bad friend who's driving an unmarked vehicle. He drives to the town. He smokes synthetic marijuana.

<!-- What I'm thinking might happen is that he bumps into the neighbour again, but she needs to help him. -->
