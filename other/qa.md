# Why is it called How to kill a Chinaman?

I suppose there's a few themes at play. The main character is part Chinese and the book describes his gradual degradation in life. Even though killing seems like something instantaneous, the character is very much experiencing a slow death. Perhaps he is already in purgatory, who knows.



# Am I mentally okay?

Although the book touches on some very dark moments and overall paints a very broken man, I am doing fine. There is no possibly way I could have written a book without my mental health intact.


# Why do some characters not have names? In fact, why does Milo only have a name?

Itâ€™s to emphasis the priority of the character and how he thinks. He only cares about what he can fuck.

The idea behind this novel is that you never really get to know too much about the character. The actual details of his life is inconsequential. Rather, the idea is that you only get to experience his life through his own observations. His subjective understanding.

In fact, the moment you start talking about specifics is when you not only begin to lose the charm of the writing, but it also destroys the illusion that the character is being honest.

Ultimately the character is trying to prove that he's human. He wants that so badly.


# What are some of the central themes of the novel?

In essence, this is a novel about bipolar disorder. The first half of the novel describes the depression and the downfall and the second half of the novel describes the ascent.

Part of what I wanted to do with this book, and perhaps why it was so fun to write, was take absolutely everything to an extreme. Every line, every situation, every describe, simulating what I would describe as a punch to the face.

# Is it an autobiography?

Although the novel may seem highly inspired by my own life, the writing style alone

In part because it's incredibly difficult to pertain to the whimsical style of the novel while also being highly factual. The factuality breaks the joy of the writing in a lot of ways, so in the end you have to sort of keep things highly fictionalised. This is something I struggled with greatly. What I realised in the end, is that ultimately it always comes down to what the character is observing. That is where the magic is.

# What do you do when you get stuck?

I find that when you're feeling creatively stuck or frustrated, is when it's the perfect opportunity to edit your work. Because in these moments your mind simply refuses to work with you, is a perfect state of mind for picking out what's wrong with your writing. It forces you into a position where you absolutely must make your writing as readable as possible.


The character's life is largely expressed through dread and cynicism. Everything is weary. Everything is forced and feels artificial.
