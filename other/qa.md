How to Kill a Chinaman

# Summary

When I think about it, the central theme of this book is about coping. The entire narrative centers around the main character and their ability to cope. That's his style. That's his story.

# Time and place.

The story starts on a Friday.

# Pros
- There is a clear structure to this novel, that is incredibly well documented.
- Each chapter is distinctly comprised of 3 sections, it wouldn't be too difficult to re-arrange the novel, or even break the chapters down into smaller segments.

# Cons

- The writing itself is very lyrical and verbose and is not only difficult, but time-consuming to edit.

- It's kind of like Peep Show, in that's largely the thoughts of the main character and how they interact within itself.

# Brief description?

The story is about a mentally-ill young man. The story is told through the thoughts and observations of the main character, which reflects his hyperbolic imagination of hyper-fantasy and cynicism. The story begins with an interaction with the main character and an editor, in a quest to get his book published. The overarching plot however reveals a suicidal descent into destitution. The character ends up disowning his family. Breaking up with his lover. Losing his job. Before leading to an untimely drug overdose.

Ultimately, there are two themes. It intends to be an incredibly graphic, sexual and violent foray into what it means to be a Chinese person growing up in Western society. I also wanted the novel to represent a full cycle of bipolar mania, from beginning to finish.

Please keep in mind that this book is highly controversial.
perhaps beyond which can be published.

<!--
The story is told through the thoughts and observations of the main character, who is never truly revealed. The only character with a name is his love interest, Milo. Only a fraction of his thoughts actually describe what is taking place in each scene, both in terms of what he is feeling as well as what is actually happening. Instead, a vast majority of his commentary paints a broken fantasy land of extreme hyperbolic tension and crushing cynicism. It is an incredibly graphic, sexual and violent foray into what it means to be an Asian person growing up in Western society. -->

# What is the intention of the novel?

I want the reader to be able to taste the self-hate.

The novel attempts to reveal what it means to be a contemporary Asian person through the eyes of unadultered counter-culture. In other words, what's sorely lacking in Western culture is Chinese counter-culture. You know, the kind of stuff that kids listen to on their Spotify accounts, which tells them to go fuck themselves, and which helps develop their sense of purpose and self-esteem in life.

How to Kill a Chinaman is delicate construction of hard-hitting counter-culture which I believe competes with the best of them. I wanted to recreate the sense of feeling that I had as a young adult reading William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch, only for a new generation. Disgust. Obsession. Depravity. Whore. The novel is a contemporary reflection of a Chinese man's experience in Western society, which intends to smear shit into the reader's eyes, and leave them in a puddle of their own guilt. All while, beautifully written as if delivered by a stark angel with ornate wings.

In a way, the book is an ode to the 1950s beat generation. I wanted to write a modern take on that.



# Why is it called How to kill a Chinaman?

It relates to the rejection I feel for my half-chinese side.

The book is a reflection of the slow degredation of a Chinese man attempting his best to copie in Western society. The title may also been seen as a reflection of the character's self-worth; a person worth dying. It doesn't intend to be a statement against China. It intends to be a statement against the individual.

It also resembles a rejection of ethnicity. The killing of one's own ethnicity. Ultimately although I am half chinese, having been brought up a single Chinese mother, I fully identify with being Chinese.

Perhaps it also has to do with my upbringing.

It also seems to play on the racism against Chinese people. Chinese people are generally seen as being lesser to whites, which is particularly evident with our food. It's considered to be cheaper, more nasty etc. etc.

# What are some of the central themes of the novel?

In essence, this is a novel about bipolar disorder. The first half of the novel describes the depression and the downfall and the second half of the novel describes the ascent.

# Is it an autobiography?

Yes and no. It's too whimsical to be an autobiography, yet it's also largely inspired by my own experiences and feelings in life. And although I am clearly channeling my thoughts and will into the main character, the main character is not explicitly me.

# What do you do when you get stuck?

I find that when you're feeling creatively stuck or frustrated, is when it's the perfect opportunity to edit your work. Because in these moments your mind simply refuses to work with you, is a perfect state of mind for picking out what's wrong with your writing. It forces you into a position where you absolutely must make your writing as readable as possible.

# What are some challenges?

As a fictional title, there is no blueprint. Ultimately I'm trying to create an story that I hope engages people. That's the best I can achieve and it's hard, because I don't know what that is.

# Am I mentally okay?

Although the book touches on some very dark moments and overall paints a very broken man, I am doing fine. I'm not mentally perfect, and perhaps I'll never be. However there's no possibe way I could have written a book without my mental health intact. It is an incredibly demanding task which

My secondary intention was to demonstrate that you can still have creative flair without being mentally ill. Although the book contains the severe ramblings of a person with bipolar disorder, who I am today is quite different.

# Why do some characters not have names? In fact, why does Milo only have a name?

Itâ€™s to emphasis the priority of the character and how he thinks. It really is a reflection of his idea of romance. He only cares about that image of perfection he has in his mind, which he has equated with

The idea behind this novel is that you never really get to know too much about the character. The actual details of his life is inconsequential. Rather, the idea is that you only get to experience his life through his own observations. His subjective understanding.

In fact, the moment you start talking about specifics is when you not only begin to lose the charm of the writing, but it also destroys the illusion that the character is being honest.

Ultimately the character is trying to prove that he's human. He wants that so badly.

# Why am I qualified to write this book?

I'm half Chinese, with a fairly traditional Chinese upbringing. I had to attend Saturday School, play an instruction, along with all that jazz. I have since disowned my mother. The main reason why I'm qualified to write this book is because I've been writing in this counter-culture style since I started my first blog at 14. Following a few years of experimenting with my writing style in the form of short essasy. Once I felt like I'd truly discovered my writing style, I then decided that I would have the maturity to write a novel.

# Why is this book important?

Because it is authentic. Because it is raw. Because it talks about very real topics which remain hidden in mainstream discourse, such as estrangement.

# What is my X-Factor as a writer?

I'm not sure if it's a special ability, but I have this thing where I'm able to use words perfectly that I don't know the meaning of. Although I suppose it comes down to how I understand words. I treat them more as a feeling, rather than an understanding. I just intuitively know the context of what they're trying to convey, based on how they sound and how they make me feel.

# Concerns

This will be an absolute bastard to edit. It will not be quick. It will require every ounce of your attention, to catch the nuances and lyricism of each and every phrase.

Truth is, the novel doesn't need to make sense. It just needs to read well. It needs conviction and it needs prose. That's what this book is about.


# Words which describe this book

Macabre

You know, in a way it's like all my novels are part of the same universe. Just different perspectives at different times.


Maybe the next book could be about my friendship with Amelia. In a way, there are elements of Amelia within Milo. I suppose there's elements of every girl I've ever dated within Milo, which isn't really saying much.

You know actually, if I had to write another book it would make sense to write it from Milo's perspective. Because when you think about it, I only really have one story to tell. One character. But to develop it from a female's perspective (well, my perspective of a female) then that would work quite well, I think.



On the one hand, this book is perfect for those with a vivid imagination, because it really does take you to a very broken place. By the same token, the book is also awful in that

Book idea. Book is called Mother and Son, and it explores the tension between a mother and his son. Visually I want it to be like a mosaic of colour. Basic themes with abstract outcomes. Bordering surreal. It's like watching an organism grow. The son is simply an idea, that grows in awareness and questions the premise of the relationship.

"I am son. The son of mother. The mother of son. Apparently she is standing there in front of me. Eyes like a vibrant monsoon. Washing me away from my senses. I am not familiar with her touch. It is like frozen ice, although I'm"




The Tales of Amelia Snow - It's a coming of age story about a girl with autism. She begins knowing nothing about the world, and slowly develops and learns to adapt to it. I want maybe the 1st half to explore her childhood. Then it develops into her later years.
