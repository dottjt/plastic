How to Kill a Chinaman

# Brief description?

The story is about a sick, deranged, mentally-ill young man. The story is told through the thoughts and observations of the main character, which reflect his hyperbolic imagination of fantasy sex and crushing cynicism. The story begins with the main character meeting with an editor, in a quest to get his book published. The overarching plot however reveals a suicidal descent into destitution. The character ends up disowning his family. Breaking up with his lover. Losing his job. Before leading to an untimely drug overdose.

Ultimately, there are two themes. It intends to be an incredibly graphic, sexual and violent foray into what it means to be an Asian person growing up in Western society. I also wanted the novel to represent a full cycle of bipolar mania, from beginning to finish.

The story is told through the thoughts and observations of the main character, who is never truly revealed. The only character with a name is his love interest, Milo. Only a fraction of his thoughts actually describe what is taking place in each scene, both in terms of what he is feeling as well as what is actually happening. Instead, a vast majority of his commentary paints a broken fantasy land of extreme hyperbolic tension and crushing cynicism. It is an incredibly graphic, sexual and violent foray into what it means to be an Asian person growing up in Western society. -->

# What is the intention of the novel?

The novel attempts to reveal what it means to be a contemporary Asian person through the eyes of unadultered counter-culture. In other words, what's sorely lacking in Western culture is Chinese counter-culture. You know, the kind of stuff that kids listen to on their Spotify accounts, which tells them to go fuck themselves, and which helps develop their sense of purpose and self-esteem in life.

How to Kill a Chinaman is delicate construction of hard-hitting counter-culture which I believe competes with the best of them. I wanted to recreate the sense of feeling that I had as a young adult reading William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch, only for a new generation. Disgust. Obsession. Depravity. Whore. The novel is a contemporary reflection of a Chinese man's experience in Western society, which intends to smear shit into the reader's eyes, and leave them in a puddle of their own guilt. All while, beautifully written as if delivered by a stark angel with ornate wings.

# Why is it called How to kill a Chinaman?

The book is a reflection of the slow degredation of a Chinese man attempting his best to copie in Western society. The title may also been seen as a reflection of the character's self-worth; a person worth dying. It doesn't intend to be a statement against China. It intends to be a statement against the individual.

# What are some of the central themes of the novel?

In essence, this is a novel about bipolar disorder. The first half of the novel describes the depression and the downfall and the second half of the novel describes the ascent.

# Is it an autobiography?

Yes and no. It's too whimsical to be an autobiography, yet it's also largely inspired by my own experiences and feelings in life. And although I am clearly channeling my thoughts and will into the main character, the main character is not explicitly me.

# What do you do when you get stuck?

I find that when you're feeling creatively stuck or frustrated, is when it's the perfect opportunity to edit your work. Because in these moments your mind simply refuses to work with you, is a perfect state of mind for picking out what's wrong with your writing. It forces you into a position where you absolutely must make your writing as readable as possible.

# What are some challenges?

As a fictional title, there is no blueprint. Ultimately I'm trying to create an story that I hope engages people. That's the best I can achieve and it's hard, because I don't know what that is.

# Am I mentally okay?

Although the book touches on some very dark moments and overall paints a very broken man, I am doing fine. I'm not mentally perfect, and perhaps I'll never be. However there's no possibe way I could have written a book without my mental health intact. It is an incredibly demanding task which

My secondary intention was to demonstrate that you can still have creative flair without being mentally ill. Although the book contains the severe ramblings of a person with bipolar disorder, who I am today is quite different.

# Why do some characters not have names? In fact, why does Milo only have a name?

Itâ€™s to emphasis the priority of the character and how he thinks. It really is a reflection of his idea of romance. He only cares about that image of perfection he has in his mind, which he has equated with

The idea behind this novel is that you never really get to know too much about the character. The actual details of his life is inconsequential. Rather, the idea is that you only get to experience his life through his own observations. His subjective understanding.

In fact, the moment you start talking about specifics is when you not only begin to lose the charm of the writing, but it also destroys the illusion that the character is being honest.

Ultimately the character is trying to prove that he's human. He wants that so badly.


# Why am I qualified to write this book?

I'm half Chinese, with a fairly traditional Chinese upbringing. I had to attend Saturday School, play an instruction, along with all that jazz. I have since disowned my mother. The main reason why I'm qualified to write this book is because I've been writing in this counter-culture style since I started my first blog at 14. Following a few years of experimenting with my writing style in the form of short essasy. Once I felt like I'd truly discovered my writing style, I then decided that I would have the maturity to write a novel.
