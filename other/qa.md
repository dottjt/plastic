# Why is it called How to kill a Chinaman?

I suppose there's a few themes at play. The main character is part Chinese and the book describes his gradual degradation in life. Even though killing seems like something instantaneous, the character is very much experiencing a slow death. Perhaps he is already in purgatory, who knows.

Hi. I hoped you liked my book. Firstly, I would like to say although the book touches on some very dark moments and overall paints a very broken man, I am doing fine.


# Why do some characters not have names? In fact, why does Milo only have a name?

Itâ€™s to emphasis the priority of the character and how he thinks. He only cares about what he can fuck.
